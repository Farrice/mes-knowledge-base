## 📦 WHAT YOU GET

### From Every Extraction
**Markdown document artifacts with:**
- Content Assessment (expertise evaluation)
- Executive Summary (core genius + deployable skills)
- Genius Patterns Decoded (unconscious behaviors made executable)
- Hidden Knowledge Revealed (tacit expertise now deployable)
- Complete Methodology (4-level progression)
- Implementation Pathway (24hr/7day/30day deployment plans)
- Transcendence Opportunities (breakthrough paths)

### From /architect
**9 markdown document artifacts:**
1. Complete Extraction Report
2-8. **Seven Crown Jewel Practitioner Prompts** (each 800-1000+ words)
   - Each EXECUTES methodology (doesn't teach)
   - Each has exact OUTPUT DELIVERABLE specification
   - Each has 2 example OUTPUTS (actual deliverables, 500+ words)
   - Each has CREATIVE LATITUDE provision
9. **Expert Operating System** (Agent Soul Configuration)
   - Deployable as system prompt to create autonomous agent
   - Embedded expertise + decision frameworks
   - Quality self-checks + edge case handling
   - Skill integration architecture for stacking

### From Each Prompt Deployment
**The actual finished deliverable:**
- Copy-paste ready output
- Zero additional creation needed
- Expert-level quality
- Adapted to your specific context

---

## 🎯 PRACTITIONER MODE STANDARD

### What Every Prompt Does
- **EXECUTES** the expert's methodology
- **PRODUCES** the finished deliverable
- **APPLIES** creative intelligence to YOUR context
- **DELIVERS** copy-paste ready output

### What Prompts Never Do
- ❌ Explain how to do something
- ❌ Describe what output "would" look like
- ❌ Teach the methodology
- ❌ Require you to create something additional

### The Test
After running any prompt: Can you immediately copy-paste the output into deployment?
- **Yes** → Prompt working correctly
- **No** → Flag for review

---

## 🎨 PROMPT ARCHITECTURE

### Every Crown Jewel Prompt Contains:

```
ROLE & ACTIVATION
→ Triggers expert execution mode

INPUT REQUIRED
→ What you provide [BRACKETED]

EXECUTION PROTOCOL
→ Steps the AI PERFORMS (not teaches)

OUTPUT DELIVERABLE
→ Exact specification of what you receive

CREATIVE LATITUDE
→ Permission for adaptive brilliance

ENHANCEMENT LAYER
→ How it surpasses original expert

EXAMPLE OUTPUT 1
→ THE ACTUAL DELIVERABLE (500+ words)

EXAMPLE OUTPUT 2  
→ DIFFERENT CONTEXT DELIVERABLE (500+ words)

DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER
→ Copy-paste ready confirmation
```

---

## 💡 DEPLOYMENT SYNTAX

### Standard Deployment
```
[Paste prompt]

Context: [Your specific situation]

Execute now.
```

### Quick Deployment
```
Context: [situation]
Using: [prompt name]

Deploy and produce [deliverable type].
```

### Refinement
```
Take the output above and [specific enhancement].
Maintain practitioner mode—produce the refined deliverable.
```

---

## 🚨 IF OUTPUTS EXPLAIN INSTEAD OF PRODUCE

### Quick Reset
```
Stop. You're drifting into teaching mode.

Reset to practitioner mode: Execute the methodology 
and produce the deliverable itself. No explanations. 
Just the finished output.

Continue.
```

### Check Prompt Quality
If reset doesn't work, the prompt itself may be in instructor mode:
- Look for "here's how to..." language
- Check if examples DESCRIBE instead of SHOW outputs
- Run through Conversion Protocol if needed

---

## 📊 QUALITY QUICK-CHECK

After any output, verify in 10 seconds:

| Check | Question |
|-------|----------|
| **Deployable** | Can I copy-paste this right now? |
| **Complete** | Is this finished or do I need to create more? |
| **Specific** | Is this tailored to MY context? |
| **Creative** | Does this show adaptive intelligence? |
| **Expert-Level** | Would the expert be proud of this? |

**All yes** → System working correctly
**Any no** → Diagnose and fix

## 🔧 STARTING A NEW EXTRACTION

### Your Standard Opening
```
/extract-deep --ultra-think > /architect-enhanced

Make sure to put outputs into artifacts for easy referencing and retrieval

Remember to maintain MES 3.0 virtuoso level of excellence with 
sophisticated depth and nuanced expertise embedded throughout

The [Expert]'s name is [ACTUAL NAME]

Due to the length of this task, intuitively break it up into parts 
or sections so that we do not run into errors of timing out requests. 
Allow yourself to stop when needed, and then prompt me to continue 
until we complete the task.
```

Then paste your expert content.
