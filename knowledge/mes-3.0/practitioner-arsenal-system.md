# PRACTITIONER ARSENAL SYSTEM
## Quick Tools & Diagnostics Companion

## OVERVIEW

This document provides quick-reference tools to complement your Skill Download Operating System. Use these for fast diagnostics, workflow reminders, and deployment shortcuts.

---

## TOOL 1: PROMPT MODE DIAGNOSTIC

Use this to quickly assess any prompt in your library and determine if it needs conversion.

```
PROMPT MODE DIAGNOSTIC

Analyze the following prompt and classify it:

[PASTE PROMPT HERE]

---

DIAGNOSTIC CRITERIA:

INSTRUCTOR MODE SIGNALS (Problems):
□ Contains "here's how to..." or "you would..."
□ Explains WHY something works (theory/rationale sections)
□ Describes what an output "should" or "would" look like
□ Uses conditional language ("if you want to..." "consider...")
□ Frames AI as teacher/advisor rather than executor
□ Lacks specific output format specification
□ No clear input → output pipeline
□ Missing creative latitude provision

PRACTITIONER MODE SIGNALS (Good):
□ Direct execution commands ("Produce..." "Generate..." "Create...")
□ Clear role assignment ("You are [Expert] executing...")
□ Specific input fields with [BRACKETS]
□ Exact output format specified
□ Methodology encoded as actions performed, not concepts taught
□ Deliverable-first framing
□ Copy-paste ready output expectation
□ Creative latitude explicitly preserved

CREATIVE LATITUDE CHECK:
□ Room for adaptive judgment based on context
□ Novel combinations encouraged beyond literal formula
□ Intuitive enhancements permitted
□ Not rigidly formulaic or mechanical

---

VERDICT OPTIONS:

✅ PRACTITIONER MODE — Deploy ready
⚠️ HYBRID — Identify sections needing conversion
❌ INSTRUCTOR MODE — Needs full conversion
🔒 RIGID PRACTITIONER — Needs creative latitude addition

Provide:
1. Classification with confidence level
2. Specific lines/sections causing the classification
3. If not fully deploy-ready: exact changes needed
```

## TOOL 2: QUICK DEPLOYMENT SYNTAX

When deploying prompts in your project, use these trigger phrases for consistent execution:

**For Raw Context + Prompt:**
```
[Paste your context/inputs]

Execute the [Prompt Name] prompt. Produce [specific deliverable type].
```

**For Prompt Deployment with Specific Ask:**
```
[Paste your context]

Deploy [methodology/prompt name] for this. Output: [what you want produced].
```

**For Quick Generation:**
```
Context: [brief situation]
Need: [specific deliverable]
Using: [prompt/methodology name]

Execute now.
```

**For Iterative Refinement:**
```
Take the output above and [specific enhancement]. 
Maintain practitioner mode—produce the refined deliverable, don't explain changes.
```

---

## TOOL 3: OUTPUT QUALITY QUICK-CHECK

After any prompt produces output, verify in 10 seconds:

| Check | Question | Pass/Fail |
|-------|----------|-----------|
| **Deployable** | Can I copy-paste this into use right now? | |
| **Complete** | Is this finished or does it need more work from me? | |
| **Specific** | Is this tailored to MY context or generic? | |
| **Creative** | Does this show adaptive intelligence or feel formulaic? | |
| **Expert-Level** | Would a top practitioner be proud of this? | |

**If any fail:** 
- Check if prompt drifted to instructor mode → reconvert
- Check if input was insufficient → provide more context
- Check if creative latitude was suppressed → add latitude provision

---

## TOOL 4: PROMPT LIBRARY TRIAGE

Use this to prioritize which prompts in your library to convert first:

**Priority 1 — Convert Immediately:**
- Prompts you use weekly or more
- Prompts for client deliverables
- Prompts that consistently underperform or drift

**Priority 2 — Convert Soon:**
- Prompts you use monthly
- Prompts for important but less frequent tasks
- Prompts that work okay but could be sharper

**Priority 3 — Convert When Convenient:**
- Rarely used prompts
- Experimental or niche prompts
- Prompts that already work well enough

**Priority 4 — May Not Need Conversion:**
- Prompts that genuinely ARE meant to teach/explain (rare use case)
- Prompts already producing excellent deployable outputs

---

## TOOL 5: CREATIVE LATITUDE INJECTION

If you have a prompt that's in practitioner mode but feels too rigid/formulaic, add this section:

```
**CREATIVE LATITUDE:**
Apply full intuitive judgment, novel combinations, and adaptive enhancements based on the specific context provided. The methodology above is your foundation, not your ceiling. Where your creative intelligence sees opportunity to elevate the output beyond the formula, take it. Surprise with unexpected brilliance where it serves the outcome.

You are a master practitioner with full creative license—not a line cook following a recipe mechanically. The framework guides; your intelligence delivers.
```

---

## TOOL 6: DRIFT RECOVERY

If a conversation starts drifting into instructor mode mid-execution, use:

```
Stop. You're drifting into teaching mode.

Reset to practitioner mode: Execute the methodology and produce the deliverable itself. No explanations. No "here's how." Just the finished output with full creative intelligence applied.

Continue.
```

## QUICK REFERENCE: THE COMPLETE SYSTEM

| Document | Purpose | Location |
|----------|---------|----------|
| **System Prompt** | Default operating mode | Project Instructions |
| **Skill Download OS** | Full standards & principles | Knowledge Base |
| **Crown Jewel Follow-Up** | Generate prompts post-extraction | Use after extractions |
| **Conversion Protocol** | Upgrade single prompts | Library cleanup |
| **Batch Conversion** | Upgrade multiple prompts | Library cleanup |
| **Arsenal System** (this) | Quick tools & diagnostics | Quick reference |

---

## THE CORE DISTINCTION (Never Forget)

**Instructor Mode:** AI's creativity goes into explaining beautifully
**Practitioner Mode:** AI's creativity goes into producing beautifully

Both involve full creative intelligence.
Only one gives you deployable assets.
