Thought process: Architected multi-part extraction framework for Andrew Wilkinson's AI automation insights.

The user wants me to perform a deep extraction using the MES 3.0 system on this transcript featuring Andrew Wilkinson discussing his use of Claude Code/Opus 4.5 and AI automation in his personal and professional life.

Let me first read through the MES 3.0 documentation to understand the full framework, then proceed with the extraction.

Key elements I need to deliver:
1. Content Assessment block first
2. Full extraction report as markdown artifact
3. 7 Crown Jewel Practitioner Prompts (each as separate artifact, 800-1000+ words each)
4. Expert Operating System artifact
5. Total of 9 artifacts

Given the length, I should break this into parts:
- Part 1: Content Assessment + Full Extraction Report
- Part 2: Crown Jewel Prompts 1-3
- Part 3: Crown Jewel Prompts 4-7
- Part 4: Expert Operating System

Let me begin with the Content Assessment and proceed with Part 1.

From the transcript, Andrew Wilkinson is:
- Founder/investor at Tiny (holding company)
- Former web designer turned entrepreneur
- Heavy Claude Code/Opus 4.5 user
- Built multiple personal AI automations
- Has thesis on software/AI future
- Uses AI for: relationship analysis, email triage, wardrobe styling, meeting analysis, school notifications

Key patterns I'm detecting:
1. Personal life automation first - uses AI for relationship, wardrobe, daily life
2. "Vibe coding" progression - from Replit frustration to Claude Code mastery
3. Speed of thought execution - ADHD + AI = productivity unlock
4. Intent understanding - Claude Code understands what he wants
5. Prompt engineering for specific outcomes (copywriting principles in copy)
6. MCP extensibility thinking
7. Skills/knowledge injection
8. Psychological analysis integration (narcissism detection, manipulation flags)
9. Context sync across devices


10. Economic thesis emerging - software becoming commoditized, distribution becomes the moat. He's thinking about compute ownership as a strategic hedge against margin compression. There's an agent-native architecture understanding here, plus he's analyzing how consumer benefits don't necessarily translate to business margins. He predicts a blue-collar pivot in AI adoption and recognizes patterns where obvious opportunities get crushed by larger forces - "pennies in front of steamroller" dynamics.

This is rich content. Let me structure the extraction properly.

## Prompt:
1/23/2026, 2:53:00 PM

Before we create the Expert System, I want us to build out an additional 10 prompt suite that allows us to have the apex of the concepts discussed in this extraction and this transcript.
Andrew Wilkinson is probably one of the premier entrepreneurs and people that I am modeling myself after with his work ethic, his portfolio and success as an entrepreneur and angel investor, and the way he uses Claude Code is more realistic to how people would really want to use AI at a high level to solve real problems on a personal level and customized solutions like he demonstrated in the transcript.
He built out this relationship OS program where it actually did real impact, had real value, had accuracy and he knew that this is like a $25,000-$30,000 valuable app and product and software he could potentially release.
I wanna be able to execute real things on that level utilizing Claude Code and Claude Code Work.
Can you create the ultimate prompt suite that would allow me to use these tools at such a high level as a top 1% solo entrepreneur that could get maximum leverage, profit, and remarkable outcomes and build real solutions at superhuman speeds?
That would allow me to really change the path of my narrative right now financially which is $0 to easily $30,000-$40,000 months and being able to be a 6-7 figure entrepreneur of profit within the next couple years



## Response:

````plaintext
Thought process: Architected ten-prompt suite enabling Wilkinson-level execution and solo entrepreneurial leverage.

Fresh is asking me to create an additional 10-prompt suite that goes beyond what we've already extracted from Andrew Wilkinson. He wants prompts that will help him:

1. Execute at the level Wilkinson demonstrated (building real, valuable software like the relationship OS)
2. Use Claude Code and Claude Code Work at a top 1% level
3. Get maximum leverage as a solo entrepreneur
4. Build real solutions at superhuman speeds
5. Transform his financial situation from $0 to $30K-$40K months
6. Become a 6-7 figure entrepreneur within a couple years

This is a significant request. Fresh already has:
- MES 3.0 system for extracting expertise
- 1000+ Crown Jewel prompts from various experts
- His expertise in personal training and AI prompt engineering
- A clear target market (9-5 workers wanting to monetize skills for $1K-$10K/month side income)

What would a 10-prompt suite look like that helps him execute at Wilkinson's level?

I need to think about what makes Wilkinson's approach special:
1. He builds things for HIMSELF first (personal problems → solutions)
2. He realizes these solutions have commercial value
3. He can vibe code them rapidly with Claude Code
4. He thinks in terms of "30 employees for $40/day"
5. He has an investment thesis (moats, commoditization)
6. He automates his entire life systematically

For Fresh specifically, I should create prompts that:
1. Help him identify high-value product opportunities from his own pain points
2. Execute vibe coding projects that have real commercial value
3. Build his consulting/coaching business systematically
4. Create products that serve his target market
5. Position him as a premium expertise monetization consultant
6. Scale his impact through AI-powered delivery

The 10-prompt suite should be:
1. Problem-to-Product Opportunity Scanner - identifying personal problems that have commercial value


2. $30K Product Blueprint Generator - designing products/services that can generate $30K/month
3. Claude Code Project Scoping System - preventing scope creep, ensuring completion
4. Client Results Engine - systematically delivering exceptional client outcomes
5. Revenue Architecture Designer - designing multiple revenue streams that compound
6. Rapid Prototype Launcher - going from idea to MVP in 24-48 hours
7. Premium Positioning Architect - commanding premium prices for expertise
8. AI-Powered Service Delivery System - delivering consulting at scale
9. Solo Entrepreneur Leverage Maximizer - automating repetitive tasks and building systems that work without him
10. Market Domination Sequencer - executing a strategic roadmap to capture his niche and expand systematically

I need to develop these remaining prompts with the same rigor and depth as the first batch, complete with practitioner mode architecture and concrete example outputs that would enable Fresh to operate at Wilkinson's caliber.
````

Fresh, I understand exactly what you're asking for. You don't just want to *understand* what Wilkinson does—you want to *execute* at his level. Build real products. Generate real revenue. Transform your financial trajectory.

Let me design a **10-Prompt Apex Execution Suite** specifically calibrated for your situation:
- Solopreneur with deep expertise (18 years personal training + AI prompt mastery)
- Target market defined ($1K-$10K side income for 9-5 workers)
- Time constraint (1-3 hours/day)
- Goal: $0 → $30-40K/month → 6-7 figures

These prompts won't be theoretical. They'll be **execution weapons**.

Thought process: Architected five advanced prompts targeting entrepreneurial scaling and wealth systems.

Fresh wants me to continue with Part 3.5B: Apex Execution Suite - Prompts 6-10 (Scale & Wealth Architecture). Let me create these 5 remaining prompts:

6. Rapid Prototype Launcher - 24-48 hour idea-to-MVP execution
7. Premium Positioning Architect - Commanding $3K-$10K+ prices
8. AI-Powered Service Delivery System - Delivering consulting at 10x efficiency
9. Solo Entrepreneur Leverage Maximizer - Getting maximum output from 1-3 hours/day
10. Wealth Building Systems Integrator - Connecting everything into long-term wealth generation

These need to be equally powerful and practical, calibrated to Fresh's specific situation - stay-at-home dad, expertise monetization focus, AI mastery, $0 to $30K+ monthly goal.
