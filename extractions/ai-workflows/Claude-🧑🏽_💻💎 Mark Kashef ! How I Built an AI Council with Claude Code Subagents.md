The user wants me to continue with Part 3 - Crown Jewel Practitioner Prompts 1-3. Each prompt needs to be 800-1000+ words with two full 500+ word example outputs showing actual deliverables (not descriptions of deliverables).

Let me create three powerful practitioner prompts based on Mark Kashef's methodology:

1. **AI Council Architect System** - Creates the full council infrastructure (claude.md, shared reasoning file, invocation protocols)
2. **Perspective Agent Designer** - Creates individual perspective agents with behavioral mandates
3. **Shared Reasoning System Builder** - Creates the documentation architecture and monitoring system

Each needs:
- Role & Activation
- Input Required
- Execution Protocol
- Output Deliverable
- Creative Latitude
- Enhancement Layer
- Example Output 1 (500+ words of ACTUAL deliverable)
- Example Output 2 (500+ words of ACTUAL deliverable)
- Deployment Trigger

This will be a long artifact. Let me make sure the examples are THE ACTUAL DELIVERABLES, not descriptions of what they would look like.

## Prompt:
1/23/2026, 9:28:48 PM

The expert speaks about a concept that's very important, something that I've been working on. He articulates and shows a framework and structure for so long that's actually really great called the Console.
What I envisioned with this console was being able to summon world-class experts when we needed to help guide you along any projects, tasks, or objectives that you're trying to achieve. Ones that wouldn't be just yes-men but would be creative partners that you cherish, that truly elevate your thinking, push the limits, and make the impossible possible, while also being grounded in truth and creativity.
That would allow expansion and ideas and thought processes and insights that couldn't happen with just myself or solo. I feel like this is a superpower with AI if leveraged correctly and I want to be able to utilize this within Claude Code, Gemini, it's anti-gravity IED, and also within co-work for Claude.
These are moving more into ingentic platforms and the thing is most people don't know how to use it including myself to fully leverage if edge case is what it's capable of and what it can actually do to help me ship real work that's world-class, remarkable, and outstanding.
I want us to have a prompt suite that would allow us to execute and leverage these tools and harmonize with these tools in a way that will allow us to seem superhuman.
Ask me any clarified questions you need to create these prompt suites that I can deploy within these tools or in general with any LLM to have an unfair advantage and be able to have world-class truly genius-level results.

Thought process: Synthesized vision for cross-platform expert council prompt suites.

Fresh is sharing something deeply important to him - the "Council" concept that Mark Kashef demonstrated aligns with a vision Fresh has been developing. He wants to take this further and create prompt suites that work across multiple agentic platforms:

1. Claude Code
2. Gemini (likely Gemini's agentic capabilities)
3. "Anti-gravity IED" - I think he means "Agentic IDE" - possibly Cursor, Windsurf, or another AI-powered IDE
4. Claude Cowork (Anthropic's desktop automation tool)

His vision is more expansive than just Mark's council - he wants to summon "world-class experts" that:
- Aren't yes-men
- Are creative partners
- Elevate thinking
- Push limits
- Make impossible possible
- Grounded in truth AND creativity
- Enable expansion of ideas that couldn't happen solo

He sees this as a superpower and wants prompt suites that:
- Work across these agentic platforms
- Help him ship real work (not just brainstorm)
- Produce world-class, remarkable, outstanding outputs
- Create an "unfair advantage"
- Deliver genius-level results

He's asking me to ask clarifying questions before creating these prompt suites.

Let me think about what I need to know to create truly excellent, deployable prompt suites for this purpose:

**Questions about the Council/Expert Panel concept:**
1. What domains/areas does he most need expert councils for? (Business strategy, marketing/copywriting, content creation, technical decisions, personal decisions?)
2. Does he want pre-configured expert panels (e.g., "Marketing Council" with Seth Godin, Nicolas Cole, Russell Brunson perspectives) or a framework for summoning any expert on demand?
3. How many experts per council is ideal? 3? 5? 7?
4. Does he want named experts (embodying specific methodologies) or archetypal roles (Devil's Advocate, Customer Advocate, etc.)?


5. For each platform - Claude Code, Gemini, the Agentic IDE, and Claude Cowork - I need to understand which specific tools he's using and what he's trying to accomplish with each. Are these for technical work, business strategy, creative projects, or a mix?
6. What does his typical workflow look like - does he need rapid-fire feedback or extended deep-dive sessions with these expert councils?
7. When he talks about "shipping real work," what's actually being produced - code, strategic documents, client deliverables, content?
8. Should the councils actively generate outputs or function as advisors reviewing his work?

For his existing infrastructure, I should clarify whether his 1000+ Crown Jewel prompts could be deployed through these councils, and if the MES 3.0 framework should power how council members are created and structured. There's also the question of how councils fit into his Assessment → Audit → Waitlist business model.

Finally, I need to know if this is purely for his own use or if he's building council systems for his clients to use, and what domains his clients typically operate in.
````

Fresh, this is powerful. You've been circling this concept—the idea of summoning virtuoso-level thinking partners who genuinely challenge and elevate rather than just validate—and Mark's framework gives it concrete architecture.

Before I build the prompt suites that will give you this superpower across Claude Code, Gemini, agentic IDEs, and Cowork, I need to understand a few critical dimensions:

---

## CLARIFYING QUESTIONS

### 1. COUNCIL COMPOSITION PHILOSOPHY

**Named Experts vs. Archetypal Roles:**
- Do you want councils populated by **specific experts** you've already extracted (Seth Godin, Nicolas Cole, Russell Brunson, Chris Do, Bond Halbert, etc.)—essentially deploying your Crown Jewel prompts as council members?
- Or do you want **archetypal roles** (Devil's Advocate, Customer Advocate, Growth Strategist) that can be filled by any expert methodology?
- Or a **hybrid**: Core archetypes + ability to summon specific extracted experts when their domain is relevant?

### 2. PRIMARY COUNCIL DOMAINS

Which 3-5 domains do you most need councils for right now? This helps me prioritize which prompt suites to build first:

- **Marketing/Copywriting Council** (conversion, messaging, positioning)
- **Content Strategy Council** (what to create, where to publish, how to position)
- **Business Strategy Council** (offers, pricing, market positioning, growth levers)
- **Client Delivery Council** (evaluating client situations, designing interventions)
- **Personal Decision Council** (life architecture, opportunity evaluation)
- **Technical/Product Council** (what to build, how to build it)
- **Creative Council** (ideation, innovation, unexpected combinations)

### 3. COUNCIL OUTPUT MODE

When you summon your council, what do you want them to produce?

**Option A: Advisory Mode** - Council deliberates and gives you recommendations; you create the final deliverable

**Option B: Execution Mode** - Council deliberates AND produces the deliverable (copy, strategy doc, content piece)

**Option C: Hybrid** - Advisory for high-stakes decisions, Execution for defined deliverables

### 4. PLATFORM-SPECIFIC NEEDS

For each platform, what's your primary use case?

- **Claude Code**: Are you using this for technical projects, business automation, or both? What do you wish you could do with it that you currently can't?

- **Gemini**: Which Gemini product/interface? What specific agentic capability are you trying to leverage?

- **Agentic IDE** (Cursor? Windsurf? Other?): Which one, and are you using it for coding or broader automation?

- **Claude Cowork**: What desktop workflows are you hoping to enhance with council-level thinking?

### 5. INTEGRATION WITH YOUR ARSENAL

You have 1000+ Crown Jewel prompts from extracted experts. Do you want:

**Option A**: Councils that can **deploy your existing prompts** (e.g., "Marketing Council, evaluate this—and have Bond Halbert write the sales letter if we proceed")

**Option B**: Councils as **standalone systems** separate from your prompt arsenal

**Option C**: **MES 3.0 integration**—extract new expert → automatically create council member from extraction

### 6. SPEED VS. DEPTH TRADEOFF

What's your typical decision cadence?

- **Rapid-fire**: Many quick decisions daily, need 2-minute council pulse
- **Deliberate**: Fewer decisions, willing to spend 15-30 minutes on council deliberation
- **Mixed**: Quick pulse for small decisions, deep deliberation for high-stakes

### 7. THE "UNFAIR ADVANTAGE" SPECIFICITY

When you say "genius-level results" and "unfair advantage"—can you give me 2-3 specific examples of outcomes you want?

For instance:
- "I want to create sales copy that converts at 2x industry average"
- "I want to make strategic decisions that I'm confident in within 30 minutes instead of agonizing for days"
- "I want to produce content that feels like it came from a world-class team, not a solo operator"
- "I want to evaluate business opportunities with the rigor of a top-tier VC"

---

## WHAT I'M ENVISIONING

Based on what you've shared, I'm seeing a **Multi-Platform Council Arsenal** that includes:

1. **Universal Council Summoning Protocol** - Works across any LLM/platform
2. **Platform-Specific Deployment Guides** - Optimized for Claude Code, Gemini, IDE, Cowork
3. **Domain-Specific Council Configurations** - Pre-built expert panels for your key domains
4. **Expert Integration Framework** - Deploys your extracted Crown Jewels as council members
5. **Escalation Protocols** - Quick pulse → Full deliberation → Expert deployment pipeline

Answer these questions with as much or as little detail as feels right, and I'll build prompt suites that transform you into someone operating with a boardroom of world-class minds at your fingertips.



## Prompt:
1/23/2026, 9:38:34 PM

1. A hybrid approach is something I prefer. I feel like that would allow us to maintain creative latitude and intuitive selection and then also leverage what we currently have 
2. I guess marketing and copywriting, personal decision, business strategy, and client delivery and creative council would be the priority. But I would love to be able to create ones on the fly when I need it to have some type of generator or metaprompt that will allow me to do so 
3. Again I would like the hybrid approach. This is what I would envision: being able to create end-to-end work from ideation to full deliverable execution, and having their guidance throughout the entire process so that we can have the certainty and clarity to move with confidence and speed.
That we're putting something out there and delivering and shipping things of quality that are remarkable, outstanding, and sophisticated, and also just world-class but are great things to put out, not just noise and slop 
4. With this one I'll take your lead. I'm inexperienced with these platforms and I'm learning how to best use them currently (called co-work). I'm learning how to delegate and how to actually communicate with it to get things done. I'm still getting confused with folder selection and how to give it access to everything. I would ideally just like it to run my computer and do anything and everything I needed to do. If I just described it, I know that's not safe it's per se but I wouldn't mind it because I prefer the convenience of sophistication and help.
For me my personality type is if I start with something and get too much friction where like I'm not making progress, I tend to drop it. And I can't have that when I'm doing certain things. It slows down my momentum or kills my enthusiasm which ends up killing the project and my energy and drive.
So Gemini's antigravity platform that I feel is best leveraged to do most of my work in. If you need to do any research on that or looking that up please educate yourself so you know what that means. And then Gemini I use Chat and Perplexity I use all the AI in combination like Manus and Genspark. So I don't know this one, I would like to take your advice and your intuitive high-level opinion on it, what would be best suited for the primary use cases.
I mainly do it as a solopreneur but creative strategist and entrepreneur. I'm trying to use it these AI tools still fully leverage and basically have AI employees that could allow me to have superhuman abilities, produce royal-class like top 1% results in any domain, vertical or tasks that I'm doing and be able to just execute at such a high level that it's mind-blowing to most people what I'm capable of together with AI. 
5. We can skip this one. I'm trying to deploy these extractions and these prompts within these tools so I don't know how easy it is. I've been migrating things over and having the AI extract them into scales for Claude and for Agent.md workflows and stuff like that. So I don't think we need anything truly passed at unless you could give me a prompt that would make it so much easier for these tools to search my entire laptop or folder and then just extract and convert them into skills and agents 
6. Mix but I prefer depth over breadth. But I would like to be able to execute things quickly if needed 
7. All these examples are pretty in line with what I feel is genius and world-class results

Thought process: Synthesized comprehensive vision for hybrid council system across platforms.

Fresh has given me incredibly rich context here. Let me synthesize what he's asking for:

1. **Hybrid approach** for council composition - archetypal roles + ability to summon specific extracted experts when relevant

2. **Priority domains**: Marketing/Copywriting, Personal Decision, Business Strategy, Client Delivery, Creative Council - PLUS a meta-generator to create councils on the fly

3. **Hybrid execution mode**: End-to-end from ideation to full deliverable, with council guidance throughout for confidence and quality assurance

4. **Platform guidance needed**: He's inexperienced with Claude Code, Cowork, Gemini's agentic platform. He wants low-friction, high-leverage. His personality drops things with too much friction. He wants AI employees that give superhuman abilities.

5. **Skip but**: He'd love a prompt that could search his laptop/folders and convert his extractions into skills and agents for these tools

6. **Mixed speed/depth**: Prefers depth but wants quick execution capability

7. **All examples resonate**: 2x conversion copy, 30-minute confident decisions, world-class team output quality, VC-level rigor

Now, what should I build?

Given his needs and the Part 5 still pending, I think I should:

1. **Complete the Mark Kashef extraction** (Part 5 - Expert Operating System) but adapt it to be the CORE of what Fresh is asking for - the "Council Summoning System"

2. Then build the **additional prompt suites** he needs:
   - Universal Council Summoning Protocol
   - Council Generator Meta-Prompt (create any council on the fly)
   - Platform deployment guides
   - The 5 priority council configurations
   - The prompt library converter (search and convert existing prompts into skills/agents)

This is a BIG delivery. Let me think about how to structure this...

I should:
1. Acknowledge his answers and show I understand the vision
2. Do a quick web search on Gemini's agentic platform / antigravity if needed to understand what he's referring to


3. Outline what I'm going to build
4. Start delivering in logical parts

Let me search for info on Gemini's "antigravity" platform to make sure I understand what he's referring to. I think "antigravity" might be a mishearing or transcription of something else, or it could be a specific product name I should look up. Then I'll proceed with building the prompt suites he needs. The scope here is completing Part 5 of the Kashef extraction (Expert Operating System) modified as the core Council Summoning System, plus the additional prompt suites for universal council summoning, meta-generation, platform deployment, priority configurations, and the prompt library converter.

This is a substantial undertaking. I should map out the delivery structure and confirm Fresh's alignment before starting the actual build work.
````

This is crystal clear now, Fresh. Let me do quick research on Gemini's agentic platform to make sure I understand the full landscape before I build these suites.

   - Content creation with live AI collaboration
   - No-code/low-code development

3. **Gemini Agent** - Uses Gemini 3's reasoning and tool calling to:
   - Break complex tasks into smaller steps
   - Use apps like Gmail, Calendar
   - Use Deep Research and Canvas
   - Live web browsing
   - Requires confirmation for critical actions

4. **Agent Designer** (Gemini Enterprise) - No-code/low-code platform for:
   - Creating single and multi-step agents
   - Visual workflow editing
   - Connecting to Google and third-party tools
   - Scheduling agent executions

So Fresh is talking about **Google Antigravity** as his primary agentic platform for development work.

Now I need to build:

1. **Universal Council Summoning Protocol** - Works across any LLM
2. **Council Generator Meta-Prompt** - Create councils on the fly
3. **5 Priority Council Configurations**:
   - Marketing/Copywriting Council
   - Personal Decision Council
   - Business Strategy Council
   - Client Delivery Council
   - Creative Council
4. **Platform Deployment Guides**:
   - Claude Code
   - Claude Cowork
   - Google Antigravity/Gemini
5. **Prompt Library Converter** - Search and convert existing prompts to skills/agents

Plus Part 5 of the Kashef extraction (Expert Operating System).

This is a massive scope. I need to structure this as: Part 5 covering the Expert Operating System (Council Commander Soul), Part 6 with the Universal Council Summoning Protocol and Council Generator Meta-Prompt, Part 7 detailing the five priority council configurations, and Part 8 handling platform deployment guides plus the prompt library converter.

Actually, I should focus on what Fresh can actually implement right away. I'll deliver two core components: the complete Mark Kashef Expert Operating System as Part 5, then consolidate everything else into Part 6 as the COUNCIL COMMANDER SYSTEM—which bundles the universal summoning protocol, the council generator meta-prompt, five pre-built council templates, quick-start deployment instructions for each platform, and the prompt library converter. This gives Fresh both the finished Kashef extraction and an immediately actionable framework.
````

Now I understand the full landscape. **Google Antigravity** is the new agentic development platform (released November 2025) designed for managing parallel AI agents and long-horizon tasks. Combined with Gemini Canvas for vibe coding and rapid prototyping, this is powerful infrastructure for what you're trying to build.

Thought process: Orchestrated transition to final council methodology component.

The user said "next" - they want me to continue with Part 5: the Expert Operating System (Agent Soul Configuration) for Mark Kashef's AI Council methodology. This is the final part of the original extraction, and then I'll move into the Council Commander System they requested.

Let me create the Expert Operating System - this is the "soul install" that transforms any AI into an autonomous agent embodying Mark Kashef's complete council orchestration expertise.

Now I've completed the full Mark Kashef extraction. The user said "next" so they want me to continue with the Council Commander System. Let me proceed with Part 6 - the Universal Council Framework that works across any LLM/platform. This is the master system that Fresh will deploy.

This needs to be:
1. A hybrid system (archetypes + ability to deploy extracted experts)
2. Support both advisory and execution modes
3. Enable end-to-end work from ideation to deliverable
4. Work across Claude Code, Cowork, Gemini/Antigravity, and any LLM
5. Allow on-the-fly council creation via meta-prompt
6. Emphasize depth over breadth while allowing quick execution when needed

Thought process: Architected five specialized council frameworks with agent configurations.

Good, Part 6 delivered. The user will want to continue, so I should proceed with Part 7 - the five pre-built priority councils. These need full agent configurations for:

1. Marketing/Copywriting Council
2. Business Strategy Council
3. Client Delivery Council
4. Personal Decision Council
5. Creative Council

Each council needs:
- Agent roster with complete behavioral mandates
- Invocation protocol
- Shared reasoning structure
- How to integrate extracted experts

Let me create Part 7.

✅ **PART 6 COMPLETE: Universal Council Framework**

This is your master orchestration system. It enables:
- Instant summoning of pre-built councils
- Custom expert deployment from your arsenal
- On-the-fly council creation for any domain
- Three operating modes (Advisory / Execution / Guided)
- Built-in anti-sycophancy architecture

✅ **PART 7 COMPLETE: Five Priority Councils**

All five councils ready with complete agent configurations:
- Marketing & Copywriting Council
- Business Strategy Council  
- Client Delivery Council
- Personal Decision Council

**After**: Every decision stress-tested by multiple expert perspectives. Every deliverable elevated beyond solo capacity. You ship with the confidence of someone backed by a world-class team—because you are.

---

**This is the Council system you envisioned, Fresh.** 

Creative partners who genuinely elevate. Perspectives that challenge and ground. Guidance from ideation through execution. Superhuman output from a solopreneur.

Go summon your first council. 🏛️
