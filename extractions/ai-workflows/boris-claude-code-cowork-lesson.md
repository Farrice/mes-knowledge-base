make sure to put outputs into artifacts for easy referencing and retrieval

Remember to maintain MES 3.0 virtuoso level of excellence with sophisticated depth and nuanced expertise embedded throughout

The [Expert]'s name is Boris not "Merlin Ai"

Due to the length of this task, intuitively break it up into parts or sections so that we do not run into errors of timing out requests. Allow yourself to stop when needed, and then prompt me to continue until we complete the task

Thought process: Strategized systematic extraction framework across Boris's Claude tools expertise.

The user wants me to perform a deep extraction using the MES 3.0 system on Boris's content about Claude Code and Claude Cowork. Let me analyze this carefully.

This is a transcript of an interview/demo with Boris, the creator of Claude Code and co-creator of Claude Cowork. The content covers:
1. How to use Claude Cowork (the new product)
2. Best practices for Claude Code
3. His personal workflow and setup
4. Tips for getting the most out of these tools

Let me start with the Content Assessment and then proceed systematically through the extraction. Given the length of this task, I'll need to break it into parts:

Part 1: Content Assessment + Executive Summary + Genius Patterns
Part 2: Hidden Knowledge + Complete Methodology + Implementation Pathway
Part 3: Transcendence Opportunities + First 3-4 Crown Jewel Prompts
Part 4: Remaining Crown Jewel Prompts
Part 5: Expert Operating System

Let me begin with Part 1.

## Prompt:
1/26/2026, 3:36:47 AM

I want you to build out prompts from the four transcendent opportunities detected so that I can deploy those opportunities at scale whenever I need them. Also can you generate me a prompt that I could launch in my Claude Code for my mobile app so that I can have the full power of world-class agents, and subagents, and orchestration at my backend call on my phone?
What I run into is that I don't know how to set up to github repository or cloud settings since thats how it functions on the app instead of the desktop and then I'm not able to really use it as if it was boris setting it up for me



## Response:
1/26/2026, 3:47:10 AM

````plaintext
Thought process: Architected five scalable practitioner prompts spanning transcendence opportunities and mobile orchestration.

Fresh wants me to create:

1. **4 Transcendence Opportunity Prompts** - One for each of the transcendence opportunities I identified in the Boris extraction:
   - Opportunity 1: The "AI Operations Manager" Role
   - Opportunity 2: Living Knowledge Base as Competitive Moat
   - Opportunity 3: Device-Ubiquitous Productivity (The "Always Productive" System)
   - Opportunity 4: Self-Verifying AI Systems (The "Blindfold Removal" Principle)

2. **A Mobile Claude Code Setup & Orchestration Prompt** - This is interesting. Fresh wants a prompt he can use on his phone via the Claude Code mobile app that will:
   - Help him set up GitHub repository properly
   - Configure cloud settings for mobile use
   - Enable full orchestration capability from his phone
   - Essentially have Boris-level setup guidance built into a prompt he can deploy

The key insight here is that Fresh doesn't know how to set up the GitHub/cloud settings on mobile, which is blocking him from using Claude Code effectively on his phone. He wants a prompt that essentially acts as "Boris setting it up for him."

Let me create these as Crown Jewel Practitioner Prompts following the MES 3.0 architecture:

**Transcendence Prompt 1**: AI Operations Manager Deployment System
**Transcendence Prompt 2**: Knowledge Base Monetization Engine  
**Transcendence Prompt 3**: Device-Ubiquitous Productivity Architect
**Transcendence Prompt 4**: Self-Verifying Systems Designer

**Bonus Prompt**: Mobile Claude Code Setup & Orchestration Commander

Each should be 800-1000+ words with 2 example outputs (500+ words each) following practitioner mode.

This is a substantial request - I'll need to create 5 full Crown Jewel prompts. Let me break this into parts to avoid timeout issues.

Part 1: Transcendence Prompts 1-2


Part 2: Transcendence Prompts 3-4
Part 3: Mobile Claude Code Setup Prompt

I'll start with Part 1.

Thought process: Architected comprehensive mobile orchestration prompt addressing GitHub and cloud configuration gaps.

Good progress. Now I need to create Part 3 - the Mobile Claude Code Setup & Orchestration Commander prompt. This is the key one Fresh is asking for - a prompt he can deploy on his phone that will help him set up GitHub repository and cloud settings so he can use Claude Code from his mobile device as effectively as Boris does.

The key insight from Fresh is:
1. He doesn't know how to set up GitHub repository on the mobile app
2. He doesn't know how to configure cloud settings 
3. He wants it to feel like Boris is setting it up for him
4. He wants full orchestration power from his phone - agents, subagents, etc.

This needs to be a comprehensive setup and operation prompt that:
1. Walks through GitHub/cloud setup
2. Establishes the mobile orchestration workflow
3. Enables agent/subagent spawning
4. Creates the "Boris is doing this for me" experience

Let me create this.
