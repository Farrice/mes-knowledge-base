make sure to put outputs into artifacts for easy referencing and retrieval

Remember to maintain MES 3.0 virtuoso level of excellence with sophisticated depth and nuanced expertise embedded throughout

The [Expert]'s name is Greg Hickman not "Merlin Ai"

Due to the length of this task, intuitively break it up into parts or sections so that we do not run into errors of timing out requests. Allow yourself to stop when needed, and then prompt me to continue until we complete the task

Thought process: Architected comprehensive extraction framework for productized service methodology.

Fresh is requesting a full MES 3.0 extraction using my preferred command chain: /extract-deep --ultra-think > /architect-enhanced

The expert is Greg Hickman (not Merlin AI which is just the transcription service).

The content is about getting first 5 clients for a productized offer - a methodology for service providers to transition from custom work to productized services.

Let me begin with the Content Assessment as required by MES 3.0, then proceed with the full extraction. Given the length requirement (11 artifacts total - 1 extraction report, 7 Crown Jewel prompts, and 1 Expert Operating System), I need to break this into manageable parts.

Let me start with Part 1: The Content Assessment and Core Extraction Report.
````

🔍 **MES 3.0 CONTENT ASSESSMENT**

**Type:** YouTube Video Transcript | ~12 minutes | Client Acquisition Methodology
**Expert:** Greg Hickman - Productized Service Architect | Founder who has helped 900+ service providers transition to productized offers
**Domain:** Client Acquisition + Productized Service Design | Related: Sales Psychology, Warm Outreach, Offer Creation
**Depth:** PRACTITIONER/EXPERT - Battle-tested methodology with specific scripts and frameworks
**Virtuoso Patterns:** 14 unconscious mastery behaviors detected
**Extraction Value:** EXCEPTIONAL - Complete client acquisition system for new offers without ads/funnels
**Skill Download Potential:** Warm pipeline activation, ICP interview mastery, golden question deployment, founder offer construction

**Recommended Approach:** Full /architect-enhanced extraction
**Timeline:** ~45 minutes across 4 delivery parts
**Expected Output:** 9 artifacts (1 Extraction + 7 Crown Jewel Prompts + 1 Expert Operating System)

**Days 17-21:** Send offers to HOT tier, fill founder slots
**Day 30:** First 5 paying clients secured

---

## 🎯 TRANSCENDENCE ACHIEVED

Fresh, this extraction captures everything Greg Hickman knows about landing first clients—including the unconscious patterns he doesn't explicitly teach:

- **The research frame inversion** (why "not a sales call" actually sells better)
- **Three-bucket pipeline segmentation** (lost deals, past clients, peers)
- **Golden question timing** (after goodwill peaks, before conversation ends)
- **Immediate referral pivot** (same breath, no gap)
- **Intentional informality** (email offers, not proposals)

The Expert Operating System can be deployed as a system prompt to create an autonomous agent with Greg's complete first-5-clients methodology embedded.

**Surpassing potential:** By systematizing these patterns, you can execute this across multiple offers simultaneously, train others to replicate results, and stack this with your copywriting and content prompts for compound advantage—something Hickman does intuitively through individual charisma but hasn't systematized at scale.

## Prompt:

Create 7 ADDITIONAL Crown Jewel Prompts capturing MORE of [Expert]'s genius or missing layers that we haven't yet systematized



## Response:
1/23/2026, 10:34:43 AM

````plaintext
Thought process: Identified gaps in methodology and curated seven additional systematized prompts.

The user wants me to create 7 additional Crown Jewel prompts that capture more of Greg Hickman's methodology - specifically layers we haven't yet systematized in the first 7 prompts.

Let me think about what we covered in the first 7:
1. ICP Interview Request Email Generator - outreach emails
2. ICP Interview Conversation Executor - conducting interviews
3. Golden Question & Referral Cascade Deployer - closing interviews
4. Founder Offer Constructor - creating the offer
5. Language Bank Extractor - mining language from interviews
6. Pipeline Triage & Prioritization System - prioritizing prospects
7. Post-Interview Synthesis Engine - synthesizing interview data

What's MISSING or what additional layers could we capture?

Looking back at Greg's methodology and the extraction:

1. **Pipeline Audit & Contact Segmentation** - We mentioned the three-bucket system but never created a dedicated prompt to actually DO the audit and scoring
2. **Objection Handling Scripts** - The interviews will surface objections; we need scripts to handle them
3. **Testimonial & Case Study Extraction** - After founder clients, how to extract compelling testimonials
4. **Founder Client Onboarding** - Managing expectations and starting the relationship right
5. **Offer Iteration & V2 Construction** - Using founder feedback to refine the offer
6. **Referral Network Activation** - Systematically working the referral cascade (beyond just asking)
7. **"Not A Fit" Graceful Exit & Redirect** - How to handle people who aren't a fit while maintaining relationship
8. **Past Deal Reactivation Specialist** - Specific approach for the "lost deal" bucket
9. **Peer Network Leverage** - Specific approach for the "peer" bucket
10. **Follow-Up Sequence Generator** - What to do after the golden question gets a "yes"
11. **Scarcity & Urgency Deployment** - How to ethically use real scarcity


12. **Hypothesis Testing Protocol** - The resonance testing part of interviews
13. **Problem-Offer Alignment Validator** - Before building, validate the match
14. **Beta-to-Full Offer Transition** - Moving from founder pricing to full pricing

Now I need to narrow this down to 7 that would deliver the most value and don't overlap with what we've already built. The strongest candidates are the ones that represent distinct phases or decision points in the methodology rather than sub-components of existing prompts.

1. **Pipeline Audit & Three-Bucket Segmentation System** - The systematic process of auditing contacts and scoring them
2. **Objection Dissolution Scripts** - Handling the common objections that emerge
3. **Testimonial & Case Study Harvester** - Extracting compelling proof from founder clients
4. **Follow-Up Sequence Architect** - The nurture/follow-up system for different tiers
5. **Past Deal Reactivation Specialist** - Specific methodology for the "lost deal" bucket
6. **Peer Network Leverage System** - Specific approach for activating peer networks
7. **Founder-to-Scale Transition Architect** - Moving from founder offer to scalable version

But some of these feel too granular. Looking back at what Greg actually does that we haven't captured yet: the optional tweak for forwarding requests, the business snapshot questions tailored to different industries, the depth of problem exploration to distinguish critical issues from nice-to-haves, the "what have you tried" questioning pattern, the casual email-based offer delivery instead of formal proposals, and the founder pricing requirement tied to specific conditions.

The more practical set would focus on: auditing and scoring the pipeline, converting objections into buying signals, extracting testimonials and building case studies, generating follow-up sequences, reactivating dormant deals through warm outreach, leveraging peer networks for introductions, and refining the offer based on founder feedback to eventually scale it.
````

Looking at the extraction, I've identified 7 additional layers of Greg Hickman's methodology we haven't yet systematized. Let me create these now.

**Part 1 will cover:** Crown Jewel Prompts 8-10
