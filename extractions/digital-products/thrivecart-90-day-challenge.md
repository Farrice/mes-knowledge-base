Remember to maintain MES 3.0 virtuoso level of excellence with sophisticated depth and nuanced expertise embedded throughout

The [Expert]'s name is ThriveCart not "Merlin Ai"

Due to the length of this task, intuitively break it up into parts or sections so that we do not run into errors of timing out requests. Allow yourself to stop when needed, and then prompt me to continue until we complete the task

Thought process: Architected multi-part extraction strategy for digital product methodology.

The user wants me to perform a deep extraction using the MES 3.0 system on this YouTube transcript. Let me analyze what I'm working with:

1. The transcript is from a video about committing to selling digital products for 3 months
2. The user has clarified the expert's name is "ThriveCart" (not Merlin AI - that was just the transcription service)
3. Looking at the content, this appears to be from someone who has generated $2M+ selling digital products
4. The methodology covers a 90-day challenge framework for building a digital product business

Wait - I need to re-read this. The user says the expert's name is "ThriveCart" - but ThriveCart is actually a software/tool mentioned in the video. Looking at the transcript more carefully, this seems to be a content creator promoting ThriveCart. The speaker mentions:
- Generated over $2 million selling digital products
- Has 6,000 email subscribers and 11,000 Instagram followers
- Makes half a million dollars a year
- Started with a group program workbook

This is likely a creator who partners with/promotes ThriveCart. But the user wants me to attribute this to "ThriveCart" as the expert name. I'll follow their instruction.

Now let me execute the MES 3.0 extraction protocol:

1. Start with Content Assessment
2. Plan the delivery (this will be extensive - 9 artifacts total)
3. Break into manageable parts

Let me structure this:
- Part 1: Content Assessment + Full Extraction Report (Artifact 1)
- Part 2: Crown Jewel Prompts 1-3 (Artifacts 2-4)
- Part 3: Crown Jewel Prompts 4-6 (Artifacts 5-7)
- Part 4: Crown Jewel Prompt 7 + Expert Operating System (Artifacts 8-9)

This is the best way to handle the length while maintaining quality.


Starting with the content assessment now.

Thought process: Architected three comprehensive practitioner prompts with deliverables.

The user wants me to continue with Part 2, which includes Crown Jewel Practitioner Prompts 1-3. Each prompt needs to be:
- 800-1000+ words
- In practitioner mode (executes, doesn't teach)
- Has two example outputs of 500+ words each showing actual deliverables
- Follows the Crown Jewel Practitioner Prompt template

Let me create these three prompts as separate markdown artifacts.
