## STRATEGIC POSITIONING

### The "Anti-Guru" Position

Farrice explicitly positions against the "Forever-Learning Industrial Complex"—the ecosystem of courses, coaches, and gurus that profit from keeping people in perpetual learning without execution.

**What He Rejects**:
- Overpriced courses that teach without transforming
- Guru-style marketing with hollow promises
- Tactics-first approaches without alignment
- Dependency-creating business models
- Hype and manufactured urgency

**What He Champions**:
- Offers that "graduate people" rather than create dependency
- Alignment-first strategy
- Execution over endless learning
- Human-centered AI implementation
- Authentic transformation over information dumping

### The "Wounded Healer" Position

> "Traditional expert positioning: 'I've figured it all out, follow me.' Your positioning: 'I'm figuring it out WITH you, climb with me.'"

Farrice positions as a guide who is actively walking the same path as his clients—not a guru on a mountaintop, but a fellow traveler who is slightly ahead on the trail.

**Why This Works**:
- Creates authentic connection
- Removes the "guru gap" that breeds distrust
- His emergence IS the product
- Clients trust his scars, not just his competence

### The "Niche of One" Position

> "Your seeming chaos is actually your moat."

Rather than picking a narrow niche, Farrice's unique combination of skills and experiences IS his differentiation:
- 18+ years of transformation expertise
- World-class prompt engineering
- Behavior change psychology
- Spiritual depth + practical strategy
- The "wounded healer" journey

**The Insight**: "Stop trying to be a specialist. Become the generalist who architects transformation systems across domains."
