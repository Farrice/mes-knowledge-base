2. **Executive Summary** - Core genius, deployable skills, surpassing potential
3. **Genius Patterns Decoded** - Unconscious behaviors made executable
4. **Hidden Knowledge** - Tacit expertise made explicit
5. **4-Level Methodology** - Foundation → Professional → Contextual → Virtuoso
6. **Implementation Pathways** - 24-hour, 7-day, 30-day plans
7. **Crown Jewel Prompts** - 7-17 practitioner-mode prompts with examples
8. **Expert Operating System** - Agent soul configuration

## Best Practices

### Skill Stacking

Combine extractions for compound results:
- LinkedIn (Lara) + Copywriting (Cardinal Mason) = High-converting LinkedIn content
- Offers (Monk AI) + Branding (Erica) = Magnetic consulting packages
- SEO (Nathan) + Content (Kallaway) = AI-discoverable viral content

### Practitioner Mode

All prompts are designed to **execute**, not teach. They produce deliverables directly rather than explaining how to create them.

### Creative Latitude

While frameworks provide structure, each prompt allows adaptation to specific contexts and audiences.

## Contributing

This is a personal knowledge base. New extractions can be added by:
