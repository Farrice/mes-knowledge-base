## **✅ COMPLETED REVISIONS** (High Priority)

### **1. OFFER_2_THE_REBUILD** → **$10K Core Offer** ✅
**File**: `OFFER_2_THE_REBUILD_10K_REVISED_V2.md`

**Major Changes**:
- **Pricing**: $5,000 → **$10,000** (based on competitive intelligence: Marshall Goldsmith, Rich Litvin pricing)
- **Language**: Removed all crisis language ("broken," "rock bottom") → replaced with optimization language ("system failure," "corrupted code")
- **Positioning**: Added "Why Most Executive Coaches Miss This" section → emphasizes body-first differentiation
- **Case Study**: Integrated CEO transformation (28 lbs lost, $3M deal closed) with full Week 1-13 breakdown
- **Proof**: Added ROI math ($100K-$800K cost of doing nothing vs $10K investment)
- **Guarantee**: Added 50% refund guarantee (if you execute and don't see results)
- **FAQ**: Expanded to 8 questions (addresses common objections)

**Why It Matters**: This is the core revenue driver. $10K pricing aligns with high-ticket executive coaching market reality (2026).

### **2. OFFER_1_THE_INTENSIVE** → **$4,997 Bridge Offer** ✅
**File**: `OFFER_1_THE_INTENSIVE_4997_REVISED_V2.md`

**Major Changes**:
- **Pricing**: $3,000 → **$4,997** (bridges to $10K core, not undervalued)
- **Language**: Removed "beta rate expired" scarcity language → replaced with confidence ("For the skeptical executive")
- **Positioning**: Reframed as proof-of-concept (not cheaper option)
- **Upgrade Path**: $2,500 credit toward The Resurrection (net cost $7,500) → total $12,497 (vs $10K if started with Resurrection)
- **Tone**: Less defensive, more confident (no apologies for pricing)

**Why It Matters**: This bridges skeptical buyers to the $10K core offer. Premium pricing filters out tire-kickers.

---

### **3. BOOKING_PAGE_QUALIFIER_QUESTIONS** → **8 Questions (Simplified)** ✅
**File**: `BOOKING_PAGE_8_QUESTIONS_REVISED_V2.md`

**Major Changes**:
- **Question Count**: 14 questions → **8 questions** (3-5 min completion time)
- **Language**: Softer, diagnostic (not interrogative/accusatory)
- **Income Qualifier**: Added ($150K+ filter)
- **Auto-Filter Logic**: Simplified (readiness 7+ AND income $150K+ AND clear goals)
- **Auto-Reply Emails**: 4 variants (accepted, rejected: low income, low readiness, unclear goals)
- **Executive-Appropriate**: No confrontational questions, respectful tone

**Why It Matters**: Old form had 26 clicks, 0 submissions. New form projects 40-60% completion rate.

## **🎯 KEY ALIGNMENT IMPROVEMENTS**

### **Competitive Intelligence Integration**:
All 3 documents now reflect:
- ✅ **Body-first positioning** (unique differentiator vs other executive coaches)
- ✅ **High-ticket pricing** ($10K core, $4,997 bridge aligned with market reality)
- ✅ **Proof-based content** (CEO case study with metrics: 28 lbs, $3M deal, 7 hrs sleep)
- ✅ **Diagnostic language** (optimization vs crisis, system failure vs broken)
- ✅ **Executive-appropriate tone** (confident, not defensive; exclusive, not scarcity-based)
- ✅ **2026 LinkedIn algorithm insights** (depth > volume, proof > promises)
