# THE INTENSIVE: 30-DAY BODY-LED SPRINT
## $4,997 Bridge Offer — Proof of Concept Before Full Commitment

**For**: Acusio Bivona (The Resurrection Coach)  
**Last Updated**: February 11, 2026  
**Positioning**: 30-day proof-of-concept for skeptical buyers

---

## **FOR THE SKEPTICAL EXECUTIVE**

You're intrigued by The Resurrection.

But 90 days feels like a big commitment.

You want proof this works before you go all-in.

I get it.

That's why The Intensive exists.

---

## **30 DAYS TO STABILIZE THE HARDWARE**

This is Phase 1 of The Resurrection—extracted into a standalone 30-day sprint.

**Goal**: Fix the infrastructure. Prove the system works. Then decide.

**No long-term commitment. Just 30 days.**

If it works—you upgrade to The Resurrection (90 days).

If it doesn't—you walk away with a system you can execute yourself.

---

## **WHO THIS IS FOR**

### **You're a Fit If**:
✅ You're earning $150K+ (you value your time)  
✅ You're skeptical of coaching (want proof before committing to 90 days)  
✅ Your body is breaking down (sleep is broken, energy is gone)  
✅ You can dedicate 20-30 min/day for 30 days (training, nutrition, Daily Calibration)  
✅ You're ready for daily accountability (Voxer check-ins)

### **You're NOT a Fit If**:
❌ You want a quick fix (this is infrastructure work, not a crash diet)  
❌ You're not ready to commit 30 days (don't waste your time or mine)  
❌ You can't do 20-30 min/day (this requires execution)

---

## **WHAT HAPPENS AFTER 30 DAYS?**

### **Option 1: Upgrade to The Resurrection** (90 Days)

If you want to continue—you get **$2,500 credit** toward The Resurrection.

**Math**:
- The Resurrection: $10,000
- Minus Intensive credit: -$2,500
- **Net cost**: $7,500

**You pay**: $7,500 (or $4,000 x 2 payments)

**Total investment** (Intensive + Resurrection): $12,497 (vs $10K if you started with The Resurrection)

**Why the premium?** Because you're testing first. Fair trade.

---

### **Option 2: Walk Away**

If you don't want to continue—no hard feelings.

You walk away with:
- 30 days of training and nutrition protocols
- Daily Calibration habit installed
- AAR framework
- Body composition improvements (10-15 lbs lost, energy improved)

Execute it yourself. I'm here if you need me.

---

## **PRICING**

**$4,997** (pay in full)

**No payment plans** (this is a 30-day sprint—pay upfront or don't start)

---

## **WHY $4,997?**

Let's do the math.

**What you're losing now**:
- Lost productivity: 10 hours/week at $200/hr = **$2,000/week** = $8,000 over 30 days
- Poor decisions: One bad hire, deal, or partnership = **$50K-$500K**
- Health decline: One preventable health scare = **$10K-$100K**

**Total cost of doing nothing**: **$60K-$600K** (conservative estimate over 30 days)

**What The Intensive delivers**:
- 10-15 lbs lost (in 30 days)
- Energy improvement (3/10 → 6-7/10)
- Decision-making clarity (less brain fog, sharper thinking)
- Proof the system works (before committing to 90 days)

**ROI**: One better decision = **10-100x return**

$4,997 is the cost of staying stuck.

---

## **GUARANTEE**

If you show up for all 4 calls, check in daily via Voxer, execute the training and nutrition protocols, and you don't see measurable improvement in:
- Sleep (hours + quality)
- Energy (subjective 1-10 scale)
- Body composition (weight, photos)

...I'll refund 50% of your investment.

But fair warning: No one has asked for a refund. Because the system works—if you execute.

---

## **FAQ**

### **Q: Why not just start with The Resurrection (90 days)?**
A: You should. The Resurrection is the full Operating System reset. The Intensive is for skeptics who want proof first. If you're ready—skip this and go straight to The Resurrection.

### **Q: Can I extend The Intensive to 60 or 90 days without upgrading?**
A: No. The Intensive is 30 days. If you want to continue, upgrade to The Resurrection. Otherwise, you're just kicking the can down the road.

### **Q: What if I travel during the 30 days?**
A: Training is remote (TrueCoach). Calls are Zoom/phone. Voxer works anywhere. Travel is not a blocker.

### **Q: Can I get a refund if I decide it's not for me after 2 weeks?**
A: No. You commit to 30 days. If you show up, execute, and don't see results—we'll refund 50%. But "I changed my mind" is not a refund reason.
