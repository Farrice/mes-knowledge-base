#### **MEDIUM PRIORITY** (Content & Systems):

**Note**: For the remaining 7 documents that need revision, here are the exact changes required. Since these are content/marketing docs (not revenue-blocking), Acusio can start executing with the 4 core docs above while you implement these updates:

---

### **5. LINKEDIN_10_POST_SERIES_FINAL.md** → **V2 UPDATES NEEDED**

**Changes Required**:
- **Post #2** (2 AM walk-out story): Soften crisis language
  - **OLD**: "I walked out of my gym at 2 AM... I was running on fumes..."
  - **NEW**: "I was working 18-hour days, ignoring every distress signal my body sent. Sleep was broken. Energy was gone. The Operating System was crashing—and I kept ignoring the warnings."
  
- **All Posts**: Remove emoji CTAs
  - **OLD**: "DM me 'SYSTEM' 🔥"
  - **NEW**: "DM me 'SYSTEM'"

- **Add**: More executive-specific language (revenue, deals, board meetings vs generic "business")

**Status**: 90% ready — minor language tweaks only

---

### **6. 90_DAY_CONTENT_CALENDAR_RESURRECTION_COACH.md** → **V2 UPDATES NEEDED**

**Changes Required**:
- **Week 2 Content** (Exhausted Operator): Soften crisis language
  - **OLD**: "I walked out at 2 AM because I couldn't stop"
  - **NEW**: "You're working 70-hour weeks. Your body is sending distress signals. This isn't weakness—it's system overload."

- **YouTube Video Titles**: Optimize for executive SEO
  - **OLD**: "Why You Feel Empty (Even When You Succeed)"
  - **NEW**: "Why High-Performing Executives Feel Empty | The System Failure Framework"

- **Instagram Reels**: Less emotional, more diagnostic
  - **OLD**: "You built the empire. But you built it alone." (emotional)
  - **NEW**: "Revenue is up. Respect from peers. But when someone asks 'What does it feel like?'—Silence." (diagnostic)

**Status**: 85% ready — softening + SEO optimization needed

---

### **7. EMAIL_SEQUENCE_COLD_LEAD_TO_STRATEGY_CALL.md** → **V2 UPDATES NEEDED**

**Changes Required**:
- **EMAIL 1 Variants**: Soften crisis language in all 4 archetypes
  - **Exhausted Operator** (most crisis-heavy): Replace "Your body is paying the price" → "Your Operating System is overloaded"
  
- **Pricing Updates** (Post-Call Sequence):
  - **OLD**: "Investment: $5,000"
  - **NEW**: "Investment: $10,000 (or $5,500 x 2 payments)"

- **EMAIL 2**: Add more body-first language
  - **Add**: "This is why The Resurrection is body-first: we fix the hardware before we touch mindset, purpose, or strategy."

**Status**: 90% ready — pricing + minor language updates

---

### **8. PHASE_3_LEAD_GEN_MACHINE.md** → **V2 UPDATES NEEDED**

**Changes Required**:
- **4 Archetypes**: Soften crisis language
  - **Hollow Emperor**: Keep "buried alive" metaphor (good for executives)
  - **Exhausted Operator**: Replace "Your body is paying the price" → "Your Operating System is overloaded"
  - **Fading Titan**: Already good (optimization-focused)
  - **Isolated Builder**: Replace "You built it alone" → "You optimized for output—but connection got de-prioritized"

- **Email Sequence**: Update to match new 5-email structure from EMAIL_SEQUENCE_COLD_LEAD_TO_STRATEGY_CALL.md

**Status**: 85% ready — archetype softening + email sequence alignment

---

### **9. OPTION_A2_REFRAME_RESURRECTION_FOR_EXECUTIVES.md** → **V2 UPDATES NEEDED**

**Changes Required**:
- **Develop "Buried Alive" Metaphor** (this is the key reframe):
  ```
  Executives aren't rock bottom. They're buried alive.
  
  Buried under a decade of:
  → Output optimization (more meetings, more deals, more revenue)
  → Efficiency addiction (sleep less, work more, push harder)
  → Connection sacrifice (family time, friendships, self-care)
  
  You're not broken. You're buried.
  
  And Resurrection isn't about fixing what's broken.
  
  It's about excavating what's been buried:
  → Your body (the hardware that powers everything)
  → Your edge (the confidence you used to have)
  → Your purpose (the direction you lost sight of)
  
  This is The Resurrection for executives.
  
  Not crisis recovery. System recalibration.
  ```

- **Update Pricing**: $5K → $10K throughout
- **Remove**: All "rock bottom" references → replace with "buried alive"
- **Add**: Competitive differentiation section (body-first vs other coaches)

**Status**: 70% ready — metaphor development + pricing updates needed

---

### **10. EMAIL_SEQUENCES.md** (Original) → **DEPRECATE OR UPDATE**

**Recommendation**: **Deprecate this document** (superseded by EMAIL_SEQUENCE_COLD_LEAD_TO_STRATEGY_CALL_V2.md)

**Alternative**: Update to match new 5-email structure if you want to keep both versions

**Status**: Deprecated — use new email sequence instead

---

### **11. DIRECT_MESSAGE_TO_ACUSIO_HONEST_ASSESSMENT.md** → **V2 UPDATES NEEDED**

**Changes Required**:
- **Add**: Reference to competitive intelligence findings
  ```
  MARKET REALITY (Based on Competitive Intelligence):
  
  → Marshall Goldsmith charges $250K+ for C-suite engagements
  → Rich Litvin charges $50K-$200K for elite leaders
  → Liz Wiseman charges $50K-$100K+ for keynotes + workshops
  
  Your $5K pricing is undervalued. The market will pay $10K+ for:
  → Body-led transformation (nobody else is doing this)
  → 90-day intensive (faster than 6-12 month competitors)
  → Daily accountability (most coaches only do weekly calls)
  
  Raise to $10K. You're not overcharging—you're aligning with market reality.
  ```

- **Emphasize**: Body-first positioning as unique differentiator

**Status**: 95% ready — add competitive intel reference
