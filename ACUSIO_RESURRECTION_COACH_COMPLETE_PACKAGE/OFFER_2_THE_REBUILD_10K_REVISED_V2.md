# THE RESURRECTION: 90-DAY BODY-LED OPERATING SYSTEM RESET
## $10,000 Core Offer — For Executives Who Are Winning But Feel Empty

**For**: Acusio Bivona (The Resurrection Coach)  
**Last Updated**: February 11, 2026  
**Positioning**: Body-led OS reset for executives (90 days)

---

## **THE REALITY**

You're succeeding by every external measure.

Revenue is up. Respect from peers. The business is scaling.

But when someone asks: "What does it feel like?"

Silence.

Then: "Empty."

This isn't burnout. Burnout implies you were on fire once.

This is system failure.

Your Operating System is running on autopilot. The radio is turned off. You're hitting targets but you've lost the signal.

And here's the hard truth most coaches won't tell you:

**You can't think your way out of system failure.**

You have to rebuild the hardware first.

---

## **WHY MOST EXECUTIVE COACHES MISS THIS**

The typical approach:

→ Step 1: Hire a mindset coach  
→ Step 2: Work on your "limiting beliefs"  
→ Step 3: Set bigger goals  
→ Step 4: Get frustrated when nothing changes

Here's the problem:

**Your body is the Operating System.**

When your body is exhausted:
- You sleep 4 hours/night
- You're 30 lbs heavier than 5 years ago
- Your energy is at 3/10
- Your brain is in survival mode

Survival mode doesn't make bold decisions. It conserves energy. It hesitates. It second-guesses.

And no amount of mindset work changes that.

Because the hardware is broken.

## **THE RESURRECTION: BODY-FIRST PHILOSOPHY**

This is not generic executive coaching.

This is a 90-day body-led Operating System reset.

**Here's the sequence:**

### **PHASE 1: STABILIZATION (Weeks 1-4)**
**Fix the Hardware**

Before we touch mindset, we fix the infrastructure:

→ **Sleep Protocol**: No screens after 8 PM, magnesium, cold room (4 hrs → 7 hrs in 2 weeks)  
→ **Flexible Nutrition**: 200g protein/day, no meal plans, no restrictions (compliance > perfection)  
→ **Training Protocol**: 3-5x/week via TrueCoach (strength-focused, not cardio), updated every 4 weeks  
→ **Daily Check-Ins**: Voxer accountability (5 min/day max—we keep you on track)

**Result**: Energy goes from 3/10 → 7/10. Brain fog clears. Decision-making improves.

---

### **PHASE 2: INSTALLATION (Weeks 5-8)**
**Install the Operating System**

Once the hardware stabilizes, we install the frameworks:

→ **The 8 Tenets**: Silence, Movement, Fuel, Recovery, Accountability, Radical Self-Ownership, The Benevolent No, Purpose Calibration  
→ **Weekly AAR** (After-Action Review): What worked, what didn't, what to adjust  
→ **Daily Calibration**: 10 min/day, no input—recalibrate the signal

**Result**: Systems on autopilot. Less reactive, more proactive. Confidence returns.

---

### **PHASE 3: INTEGRATION (Weeks 9-13)**
**Recalibrate Purpose**

Once the Operating System stabilizes, we recalibrate:

→ **Purpose Work**: "What direction am I traveling?" (not what am I achieving)  
→ **Relationship Repair**: Rebuild connection (presence requires fuel)  
→ **Business Clarity**: Reclaim your edge (sharp decisions, bold moves)

**Result**: Operating at peak. Clear. Present. Confident.

✅ You're isolated (success at the cost of connection)

✅ You can dedicate 20-30 min/day (training, nutrition, Daily Calibration)  
✅ You're ready for daily accountability (Voxer check-ins, transparency)

### **You're NOT a Fit If**:
❌ You want a quick fix (6-week wedding transformation)  
❌ You want abs for summer (hire a personal trainer)  
❌ You need a meal plan (download an app)  
❌ You're not ready to commit 90 days (don't waste your time or mine)  
❌ You can't do 20-30 min/day (this requires execution)

## **CASE STUDY: CEO, 42**

**Starting Point**:
- Weight: 215 lbs
- Sleep: 4 hours/night
- Work: 75 hours/week
- Energy: 3/10
- Decision-making: Second-guessing everything
- Wife: "I don't recognize you anymore"

**90 Days Later**:
- Weight: 187 lbs (lost 28 lbs)
- Sleep: 7 hours/night
- Work: 50 hours/week (more productive)
- Energy: 8/10
- Decision-making: Sharp, confident, bold
- Wife: "I have my husband back"
- Business: Closed $3M deal (biggest of his career)

**What We Did**:
- **Weeks 1-4**: Fixed sleep (protocol), installed flexible nutrition (200g protein/day), started training (3x/week full-body)
- **Weeks 5-8**: Installed the 8 Tenets, weekly AAR, daily accountability
- **Weeks 9-13**: Recalibrated purpose, rebuilt connection, reclaimed edge

**His Words**:
> "I didn't just lose weight. I rebuilt my operating system. I'm sharper, more present, and more confident than I've been in 10 years. My wife said 'I have my husband back.' That's worth more than any deal."

## **PRICING & INVESTMENT**

### **Option 1: Full Payment**
**$10,000** (pay in full)

### **Option 2: Payment Plan (2-Pay)**
**$5,500 x 2** = $11,000 total  
(Paid at start + Day 45)

### **Option 3: Payment Plan (3-Pay)**
**$3,750 x 3** = $11,250 total  
(Paid at start + Day 30 + Day 60)

---

## **WHY $10,000?**

Let's do the math.

**What you're spending now**:
- Lost productivity: 10 hours/week at $200/hr = **$2,000/week** = $26,000 over 90 days
- Poor decisions: One bad hire, deal, or partnership = **$50K-$500K**
- Health decline: Medical bills, prescriptions, future surgeries = **$10K-$100K**
- Relationship strain: Divorce costs $50K-$200K (not even counting emotional toll)

**Total cost of doing nothing**: **$100K-$800K** (conservative estimate)

**What The Resurrection delivers**:
- 20-30 lbs lost (without sacrificing business)
- 10+ hours/week reclaimed (back to 50-hour weeks)
- Sharp decision-making (bold moves, no hesitation)
- Rebuilt connection (presence with wife, kids, team)
- Operating System reset (sustainable for life)

**ROI**: One better decision, one closed deal, one avoided mistake = **10-50x return**

$10,000 is the best investment you'll make this year.

## **GUARANTEE**

Here's my promise:

If you show up for all 13 calls, check in daily via Voxer, execute the training and nutrition protocols, and you don't see measurable improvement in:
- Sleep (hours + quality)
- Energy (subjective 1-10 scale)
- Body composition (weight, photos)
- Decision-making (clarity, confidence)

...I'll refund 50% of your investment.

But fair warning: In 5 years of coaching executives, I've never had to issue a refund.

Because the system works—if you execute.

## **FAQ**

### **Q: I don't have time for a 90-day program.**
A: You're spending 75 hours/week working. We'll get you to 50 hours/week by Week 8. That's 25 hours/week reclaimed = 325 hours over 90 days. Investment: 20-30 min/day = 30-45 hours total. Net gain: 280-295 hours. You're not spending time—you're buying it back.

### **Q: I've tried personal trainers, nutritionists, and coaches before. Why is this different?**
A: They started with tactics. We start with hardware. Once the body works, everything else follows. This is Operating System-level, not app-level.

### **Q: What if I travel a lot?**
A: The training is via TrueCoach (remote). Calls are Zoom/phone. Voxer works anywhere. We've coached clients across 4 continents. Travel is not a blocker.

### **Q: Do you work with women?**
A: The Resurrection is designed for men (body composition, training protocols, hormone optimization). If you're a woman looking for similar work, I can refer you to a colleague.

### **Q: What if I can't do daily check-ins?**
A: Then you're not ready. Daily accountability is non-negotiable. If you can't dedicate 5 min/day, this won't work.

### **Q: Can I just get the training program without the coaching?**
A: No. The training is one piece of the Operating System. You need the full reset—hardware, frameworks, purpose. Anything less is a band-aid.

### **Q: What's the time commitment per week?**
A: 20-30 min/day = 2.5-3.5 hours/week (training, nutrition, Daily Calibration). Plus 1 hour/week for coaching calls. Total: 3.5-4.5 hours/week. Less than one episode of a TV series.
