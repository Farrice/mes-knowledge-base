**Use cases**:
- Client asks about business strategy → use Business Coaching prompt
- Client asks about marriage → use Relationship Coaching prompt
- Need to write LinkedIn post → use Content Generator prompt
- About to make big claim → use Pushback Filter (anti-hype mode)

**Why it matters**: Helps Acusio stay grounded, avoid overpromising, and navigate client questions outside his core expertise.

---

#### **Document 10: Custom Gemini System Prompt**

### **STRATEGIC POSITIONING**

#### **Document 11: Option A2 (Resurrection Coach for Executives)**
📄 [OPTION_A2_REFRAME_RESURRECTION_FOR_EXECUTIVES_V2.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/OPTION_A2_REFRAME_RESURRECTION_FOR_EXECUTIVES_V2.md)

**What it is**: Final strategic positioning document (Resurrection Coach adapted for executives)

**Key positioning**:
- **"Buried alive" metaphor** (not rock bottom): Executives aren't broken—they're buried under a decade of output optimization
- **Body-first philosophy**: Fix hardware before software (unique vs mindset coaches)
- **Operating System reset**: Not tactics, not tips—full OS rebuild
- **90-day intensive**: Faster than competitors' 6-12 month programs

**Language standards**:
- Optimization (not crisis): "System failure," "corrupted code," "buried alive"
- Diagnostic (not motivational): "Here's what's broken," not "You can do it"
- Grounded (not hype): Proof > promises, metrics > claims

---

#### **Document 12: Competitive Intelligence**
📄 [COMPETITIVE_INTELLIGENCE_EXECUTIVE_COACHES_2026.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/COMPETITIVE_INTELLIGENCE_EXECUTIVE_COACHES_2026.md) ✅ PERFECT

**What it is**: Analysis of top 5 executive coaches dominating LinkedIn (Marshall Goldsmith, Rich Litvin, Liz Wiseman, Simon Sinek, Ethan Evans)

**Key insights**:
- **Pricing**: High-ticket coaches charge $10K-$250K (not $5K)
- **Positioning**: Own ONE framework (Multipliers, Start With Why, etc.)
- **Content**: Diagnostic > motivational, proof > promises
- **LinkedIn Algorithm (2026)**: Dwell time > all else, saves > likes, 800-1,000 characters = sweet spot

**Competitive gaps** (Where Acusio can win):
- Body-led executive coaching (nobody else is doing this)
- 90-day intensive (faster than competitors)
- Daily accountability (most coaches only do weekly calls)
- Operating System Reset metaphor (tech-savvy, relatable)

---

#### **Document 13: Honest Assessment to Acusio**
📄 [DIRECT_MESSAGE_TO_ACUSIO_HONEST_ASSESSMENT_V2.md](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/DIRECT_MESSAGE_TO_ACUSIO_HONEST_ASSESSMENT_V2.md)

**What it is**: Honest assessment of current positioning, messaging mismatch, and path forward

**Key points**:
- **Strategic insight**: The name "Resurrection Coach" isn't the problem — the *framing* around it was
- **The reframe**: Resurrection = dormant power reactivation, not crisis recovery
- **Form bottleneck**: 26 clicks, 0 submissions (fixed with new streamlined form)
- **Pricing undervalued**: $5K should be $10K (based on competitive intelligence)
- **Path forward**: Elevate the Resurrection — dormant power narrative with premium visual execution

**Verdict**: Resurrection Coach is the strongest possible positioning when paired with elevated language and visual identity.

---

---

## **CRITICAL SUCCESS FACTORS**

### **✅ DO THIS**:
1. **Pick ONE lane**: Executives earning $150K+ (Resurrection Coach for empire builders)
2. **Execute for 90 days**: No more pivots (this is the last one)
3. **Prove it with 3 clients**: Before scaling to $40K/month
4. **Gather testimonials**: Video + before/after photos + metrics (weight, sleep, hours reclaimed)
5. **Stay grounded**: Use AI Prompt Library to push back on hype
6. **Body-first always**: Lead with body transformation, not mindset coaching
7. **Daily accountability**: Check in with clients via Voxer (5 min/day)
8. **Track metrics**: Profile visits, DMs, Strategy Calls, close rate

### **❌ DON'T DO THIS**:
1. **Don't pivot again**: You've pivoted 3 times—this is the final positioning
2. **Don't over-complicate**: Simple > complex (8 questions, not 14; $10K, not $5K + upsells)
3. **Don't oversell**: Proof > promises (case studies with metrics, not generic claims)
4. **Don't skip testimonials**: Testimonials = trust = sales (3 minimum before scaling)
5. **Don't ignore the body**: You're a body coach first—lean into it (S&C background, exScience degree)
6. **Don't undervalue**: $10K is the floor, not the ceiling (high-ticket market reality)
7. **Don't chase volume**: 4 clients/month at $10K = $40K (quality > quantity)
