### **ARCHETYPE 3: THE FADING TITAN**
**Statement**: "I'm losing my edge and don't know why."

**Diagnosis**:  
You used to be sharp. Confident. Decisive.

Now? You're second-guessing yourself. Reacting instead of leading. Playing defense.

You're not losing your edge—you're **operating on corrupted code**.

**What's Broken**:  
Your operating system is fragmented. You're running 17 browser tabs, no RAM left, and the whole system is lagging.

You don't need more tactics. You need a **full system reset**.

**What Happens Next**:  
We don't fix your confidence. We rebuild your **operating system**.

- **Week 1-4**: Stabilization → Reclaim your body

### **ARCHETYPE 4: THE ISOLATED BUILDER**
**Statement**: "I'm successful but my relationships are suffering."

**Diagnosis**:  
You built the empire. But you're doing it alone.

Your wife feels distant. Your kids barely know you. Your friends stopped calling.

You're not selfish—you're **systemically isolated**.

**What's Broken**:  
You optimized for output—but you lost **connection**.

You can't fix relationships with tactics. You have to **rebuild the operating system first**.

**What Happens Next**:  
We don't fix your marriage. We rebuild your **operating system**.
