## **AUDIT RESULTS**

### **DOCUMENT 1: MASTER_DELIVERABLE_PACKAGE.md**
**Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS REVISION**

**Issues Found**:
- ❌ Still uses some crisis language ("rock bottom" references in strategic positioning section)
- ❌ Pricing structure mentions $15K anchor but doesn't explain body-led differentiation clearly
- ❌ Revenue math is conservative—doesn't reflect competitive intelligence insights on high-ticket positioning
- ⚠️ Missing emphasis on "buried alive" metaphor vs "rock bottom" for executives

**Alignment Score**: 6/10

**Rewrite Priority**: **HIGH** (This is the master doc—everything flows from here)

**Recommended Updates**:
1. Remove all crisis language, replace with optimization/system failure language
2. Add body-led positioning front and center (not buried in offer descriptions)
3. Update revenue projections to reflect high-ticket reality ($5K-$15K, not $3K bridge focus)
4. Emphasize "buried alive" metaphor for executives (Option A2 refinement)
5. Add competitive differentiation section (what makes Resurrection Coach unique)

### **DOCUMENT 2: LINKEDIN_10_POST_SERIES_FINAL.md**
**Status**: ✅ **STRONG** (Minor tweaks needed)

**Issues Found**:
- ⚠️ Post #2 ("2 AM walk-out story") feels too crisis-heavy for executives—needs softening
- ⚠️ Some posts still use emojis in CTAs (not aligned with 2026 algorithm best practices)
- ✅ Posts 1, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 are solid (diagnostic, grounded, executive-appropriate)

**Alignment Score**: 8/10

**Rewrite Priority**: **MEDIUM**

**Recommended Updates**:
1. Soften Post #2 (2 AM story) → reframe as "overloaded operator" not "broken man"
2. Remove emoji CTAs (replace with text-only: "Comment 'SYSTEM'")
3. Add more executive-specific language (revenue, deals, board meetings vs generic "business")

---

### **DOCUMENT 3: OFFER_1_THE_INTENSIVE_3000_BODY_LED_REVISED.md**
**Status**: ⚠️ **NEEDS REVISION**

- ❌ $3K price point is undervalued based on competitive intelligence (Rich Litvin, Marshall Goldsmith pricing)
- ❌ "Beta rate expired" messaging feels scarcity-based (not aligned with high-ticket exclusivity)
- ⚠️ Doesn't emphasize body-led differentiation enough (reads like generic 30-day coaching)
- ⚠️ Missing competitive positioning (why this vs other executive coaches?)

**Alignment Score**: 5/10

**Rewrite Priority**: **HIGH**

**Recommended Updates**:
1. Raise price to $4,997 (bridge to $10K core, not $5K)
2. Remove "beta rate expired" scarcity language → replace with exclusivity ("limited spots")
3. Lead with body-first philosophy (not buried in deliverables)
4. Add competitive differentiation section ("Why most executive coaches miss this")
5. Emphasize 30-day proof-of-concept (not "cheaper option")

## **OVERALL ALIGNMENT SCORE**: 6.5/10

**Summary**: 11 out of 14 documents need revision. Main issues:
- Crisis language still present (needs optimization language)
- Pricing undervalued ($5K should be $10K, $3K should be $4,997)
- Body-first differentiation not emphasized enough
- Some defensive/scarcity language (not confident/exclusive)

**Time to Fix**: 3-4 hours (High Priority docs) + 1-2 hours (Medium Priority docs) = **5-6 hours total**

**Recommendation**: Rewrite High Priority docs first (1-6), then Medium Priority (7-10), skip Low Priority for now.

---

**Next Step**: Begin rewriting High Priority documents, starting with OFFER_2 (core revenue driver).
