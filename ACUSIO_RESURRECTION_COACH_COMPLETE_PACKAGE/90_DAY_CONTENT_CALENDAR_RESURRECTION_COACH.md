## **WEEK 1: THE HOLLOW VICTORY**
**Theme**: You're succeeding but feel empty

### **LINKEDIN POST #1** (Tuesday, Week 1)
**Platform**: LinkedIn  
**Type**: Diagnostic Post  
**Hook**: "I talk to men every week who seem to have it all."

**Full Post** (967 characters):
```
I talk to men every week who seem to have it all.

The business is scaling. Revenue is up. Respect from peers. Success by every external measure.

But when I ask: "What does it feel like?"

Silence.

Then: "Empty."

This isn't burnout. Burnout implies you were on fire once.

This is something deeper.

You're operating on autopilot. The radio is turned off. You're hitting targets but you've lost the signal.

Here's what most people don't understand:

A goal is a target you hit. Purpose is a direction you travel.

You've been chasing goals for so long, you forgot to ask: "Why am I running?"

The Operating System is corrupted.

And corrupted code can't be fixed with a morning routine or a productivity hack.

It has to be rebuilt.

We aren't going to fix your morning routine.

We're going to rebuild your operating system.

If this is you—comment "SYSTEM" and I'll send you the framework.
```

**CTA**: Comment "SYSTEM" for framework  
**Expected Engagement**: 15-30 comments, 50-100 profile visits, 5-10 DMs

## **WEEK 2: THE EXHAUSTED OPERATOR**
**Theme**: Your body is breaking down

### **LINKEDIN POST #2** (Tuesday, Week 2)
**Platform**: LinkedIn  
**Type**: Confession Post  
**Hook**: "I walked out of my gym at 2 AM..."

**Full Post** (891 characters):
```
I walked out of my gym at 2 AM.

Not because I was dedicated.

Because I couldn't stop.

I was running on fumes. Sleep was broken. Recovery didn't exist. The Operating System was crashing—and I kept ignoring the warnings.

Here's what I didn't understand then:

Your body isn't weak. It's overloaded.

When you ignore the distress signals—poor sleep, low energy, brain fog—you're not pushing through. You're compounding the damage.

The Operating System can't run on corrupted hardware.

Most men come to me thinking they need discipline.

They don't.

They need Stabilization.

Week 1-4 of The Resurrection isn't about crushing workouts or aggressive diets.

It's about fixing the infrastructure: Sleep. Recovery. Fuel. Movement.

Because you can't install new software on broken hardware.

If you're exhausted, distracted, and irritable—your body is trying to tell you something.

Are you listening?

DM me "STABILIZE" if this hits.
```

**CTA**: DM "STABILIZE"  
**Expected Engagement**: 20-40 comments, 10-20 DMs

[Next frame]: "How you are now: 4 hours sleep, no gym in months, always tired"
[Next frame]: "This isn't laziness"
[Next frame]: "It's system failure"
[Final frame]: "And system failure requires a resurrection, not more discipline"

[Voiceover]: "Your body isn't weak. It's overloaded. Week 1-4 of The Resurrection: we fix the hardware first. Link in bio."
```

**Visual Style**: Split screen (past vs present), high contrast  
**Music**: Upbeat but grounded

## **WEEK 3: THE FADING TITAN**
**Theme**: You're losing your edge

### **LINKEDIN POST #3** (Tuesday, Week 3)
**Platform**: LinkedIn  
**Type**: Diagnostic Post  
**Hook**: "You used to make decisions in seconds..."

**Full Post** (923 characters):
```
You used to make decisions in seconds.

Now? You're second-guessing everything.

You used to walk into a room and own it.

Now? You're reacting. Playing defense.

This isn't imposter syndrome. You've earned your place.

This is Operating System lag.

Your system is running 17 browser tabs, RAM is maxed out, and the whole thing is lagging.

Here's the truth most won't tell you:

Your confidence didn't disappear. Your Operating System is fragmented.

When your body is exhausted, your brain goes into survival mode.

Survival mode doesn't make bold decisions. It conserves energy. It second-guesses. It hesitates.

You don't need a confidence coach.

You need a System Reset.

Week 1-4: Fix the hardware (sleep, energy, recovery).
Week 5-8: Defragment the system (install the 8 Tenets).
Week 9-13: Reclaim your edge.

This is The Resurrection.

And it starts with reactivating what went dormant under the hood.

If you're losing your edge—comment "RESET" and I'll send you the diagnostic.
```

**CTA**: Comment "RESET"  
**Expected Engagement**: 15-35 comments, 5-15 DMs

## **WEEK 4: THE ISOLATED BUILDER**
**Theme**: Success at the cost of connection

### **LINKEDIN POST #4** (Tuesday, Week 4)
**Platform**: LinkedIn  
**Type**: Confession Post  
**Hook**: "I built the empire. But I built it alone."

**Full Post** (897 characters):
```
I built the empire.

But I built it alone.

My wife felt distant. My kids barely knew me. My friends stopped calling.

And I told myself: "This is the sacrifice. This is what success requires."

I was wrong.

You're not selfish. You're systemically isolated.

Here's what happens:

You optimize for output. Meetings, deals, revenue, growth.

And connection—real connection—gets de-prioritized.

Not intentionally. It just... fades.

Your wife isn't pulling away. You're unavailable.

Your kids aren't distant. You're distracted.

Your friends didn't abandon you. You stopped showing up.

This is Operating System failure at the relationship level.

And here's the hard truth:

You can't fix relationships with tactics.

You have to rebuild the Operating System first.

Because presence requires fuel.

And fuel requires a body that works.

Week 1-4 of The Resurrection: Reclaim your energy.
Week 5-8: Install Radical Self-Accountability.
Week 9-13: Restore connection.

If you're succeeding but isolated—DM me "CONNECTION."
```

**CTA**: DM "CONNECTION"  
**Expected Engagement**: 25-50 comments, 15-25 DMs

**Type**: Case Study Post  
**Hook**: "CEO, 42, came to me at 215 lbs..."

**Full Post** (945 characters):
```
CEO, 42, came to me at 215 lbs.

Sleeping 4 hours/night. Working 75 hours/week. Irritable. Distracted. Second-guessing every decision.

His wife: "I don't recognize you anymore."

90 days later:

→ 187 lbs (lost 28 lbs)

Here's what we did:

✅ Week 1-4: Stabilization
   - Fixed sleep (protocol: no screens after 8 PM, magnesium, cold room)

   - Weekly AAR (After-Action Review)
   - Accountability check-ins (daily Voxer)

✅ Week 9-13: Integration
   - Transitioned protocols to autopilot
   - Rebuilt decision-making framework

## **WEEK 7-8: THE FRAMEWORK ARC**
**Theme**: The 8 Tenets breakdown

### **LINKEDIN POST #6** (Tuesday, Week 7)
**Platform**: LinkedIn  
**Type**: Framework Post  
**Hook**: "The 8 Tenets of Operating System Integrity"

**Full Post** (986 characters):
```
The 8 Tenets of Operating System Integrity.

This is what we install in Week 5-8 of The Resurrection.

Not tactics. Not hacks. Operating principles.

Here they are:

1. **Silence**: 10 min/day, no input. Calibrate the signal.

2. **Movement**: 3-5x/week. Maintain the hardware.

3. **Fuel**: 200g protein/day. Feed the system.

4. **Recovery**: 7+ hours sleep. Let the system reset.

5. **Accountability**: Weekly AAR. Review, adjust, repeat.

6. **Radical Self-Ownership**: No blame. Total radius ownership.

7. **The Benevolent No**: Boundaries without apology.

8. **Purpose Calibration**: Goal ≠ Purpose. Direction > target.

Most men skip straight to #8.

They want purpose. Clarity. Vision.

But purpose without infrastructure collapses.

You can't calibrate a broken compass.

So we start with #1-4 (fix the hardware).

Then #5-7 (install the frameworks).

Then #8 (recalibrate purpose).

This is the sequence.

And this is The Resurrection.

If you want the full breakdown of each Tenet—comment "TENETS" and I'll send it.
```

**CTA**: Comment "TENETS"  
**Expected Engagement**: 25-50 comments, 50-100 saves (framework posts = high saves)

### **LINKEDIN POST #7** (Tuesday, Week 8)
**Platform**: LinkedIn  
**Type**: Diagnostic Post  
**Hook**: "You're chasing goals. But goals aren't the problem."

**Full Post** (891 characters):
```
You're chasing goals.

But goals aren't the problem.

A goal is a target you hit. Purpose is a direction you travel.

You've spent the last 10 years hitting targets:

→ $100K revenue
→ $1M revenue
→ $10M revenue

But here's what happens:

You hit the target. Feel nothing. Set a bigger target. Repeat.

The dopamine spike lasts 48 hours. Then emptiness returns.

This is the Goal Treadmill.

And no amount of achievement fixes it.

Because you're optimizing for targets—not direction.

Here's the shift:

Tenet #8 (Purpose Calibration) isn't about "finding your why."

It's about asking:

"If I had infinite resources and zero fear—what direction would I travel?"

Not what would I achieve. What direction would I move?

Because achievement is finite. Direction is infinite.

Week 9-13 of The Resurrection: we don't find your purpose.

We excavate it.

Because it's already there. Buried under a decade of goal-chasing.

If this resonates—DM me "DIRECTION."
```

**CTA**: DM "DIRECTION"  
**Expected Engagement**: 20-40 comments, 10-20 DMs

[0:45-2:00] Why Frameworks Matter:
- Tactics fail because there's no foundation
- The 8 Tenets = Operating System upgrade
- Install sequence: Hardware → Frameworks → Purpose

[2:00-10:00] The 8 Tenets (Breakdown):
1. Silence (1:30 min): Why 10 min/day matters, how to do it
2. Movement (1:00 min): 3-5x/week, progressive overload
3. Fuel (1:00 min): 200g protein/day, flexible nutrition
4. Recovery (1:00 min): 7+ hrs sleep, why it's non-negotiable
5. Accountability (1:00 min): Weekly AAR framework
6. Radical Self-Ownership (1:00 min): No blame, total radius ownership
7. The Benevolent No (1:00 min): Boundaries without apology
8. Purpose Calibration (1:30 min): Direction > targets

**Full Post** (923 characters):
```
The $15K Client You Don't Want.

Let me tell you who I don't work with:

❌ "I need to lose weight before my wedding in 6 weeks."

❌ "I want abs for summer."

❌ "Can you just write me a meal plan?"

I don't do quick fixes. I don't do aesthetics coaching. I don't do surface-level transformations.

Here's who I work with:

✅ Executives who are succeeding but feel empty.

✅ Founders who are exhausted and losing their edge.

✅ Builders who optimized for output and lost connection.

✅ Men who are ready to reactivate—not just patch.

The Resurrection is 90 days. It's body-first. It's Operating System-level.

And it's not for everyone.

If you're looking for a quick fix—I'm not your guy.

If you're ready to reactivate from the ground up—let's talk.

But fair warning:

This requires daily accountability, weekly check-ins, and full commitment.

If you're not ready for that—don't apply.

If you are—comment "ALL IN" and I'll send you the Strategy Call application.

No tire-kickers. No window shoppers. All in or nothing.

**CTA**: Comment "ALL IN"  
**Expected Engagement**: 40-80 comments (polarizing = high engagement), 30-60 DMs

## **WEEK 11-12: THE FINAL PUSH**
**Theme**: Last call + social proof

### **LINKEDIN POST #10** (Tuesday, Week 11)
**Platform**: LinkedIn  
**Type**: Final Invitation Post  
**Hook**: "This is the last email."

**Full Post** (897 characters):
```
This is the last email.

I've spent the last 10 weeks breaking down:

→ System Failure (you're not broken, you're running on corrupted code)
→ The Resurrection (90 days: Stabilization → Installation → Integration)
→ The 8 Tenets (Operating System frameworks)
→ Case studies (real transformations with metrics)

If you've been following along, you know what this is.

If you're still on the fence—here's the reality:

**90 days from now, you'll either be:**

A) Right where you are now (exhausted, isolated, losing your edge)

B) 20-30 lbs lighter, 10+ hours/week reclaimed, Operating System rebuilt

The only difference?

You applied for a Strategy Call.

So here's your choice:

**Option 1**: Keep doing what you're doing. Hope it gets better.

**Option 2**: Apply for a Resurrection Strategy Call (90 minutes, free). Run an AAR on your last 12 months. Diagnose the system failure. Map the rebuild.

## **CONTENT REPURPOSING STRATEGY**

### **Turn 1 Piece of Content Into 10**

**Example: LinkedIn Post #1 (Hollow Victory)**

1. **LinkedIn Post** → Original (Tuesday)
2. **Instagram Carousel** → 5 slides summarizing the post (Wednesday)
3. **Instagram Story** → Quote card from the post (Thursday)
4. **Twitter Thread** → Break down post into 5-7 tweets (Friday)
5. **YouTube Short** → 60-second voiceover of key insight (Saturday)
6. **Email Newsletter** → Expand post into 300-word email (Sunday)
7. **LinkedIn Carousel** → Visual breakdown of framework (Next Tuesday)
8. **TikTok** → Same as Instagram Reel (if expanding platforms)
9. **Facebook Post** → Repurpose LinkedIn post (if active on FB)
10. **Blog Post** → Expand into 800-word article for SEO (long-tail)

**Time Investment**: 1 hour to create original post → 2 hours to repurpose across 10 formats = 30 pieces of content in 30 hours/month
