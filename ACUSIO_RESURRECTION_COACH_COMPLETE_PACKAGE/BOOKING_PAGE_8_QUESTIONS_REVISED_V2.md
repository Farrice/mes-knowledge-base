## Simplified 8-Question Qualifier (Executive-Appropriate)

**Last Updated**: February 11, 2026  
**Purpose**: Pre-qualify high-ticket leads before Strategy Call booking

---

## **BOOKING PAGE COPY**

### **Headline**:
**Apply for a Free Resurrection Strategy Call**

### **Subheadline**:
90 minutes. No hard sell. Just clarity.

### **Body Copy**:
```
This is not a sales call.

This is a 90-minute After-Action Review (AAR) on your last 12 months.

We'll diagnose the system failure—sleep, energy, decision-making, connection.

And we'll map the 90-day rebuild.

If it's a fit—we move forward with The Resurrection ($10K, 90 days).

If it's not—you walk away with a roadmap you can execute yourself.

Either way, you're better off than you are today.

---

**To apply, answer 8 questions below.**

This takes 3-5 minutes. Be honest—there are no wrong answers.

If you're a fit, I'll send you a Calendly link within 24 hours.

If you're not, I'll tell you why (and point you in the right direction).

Let's go.
```

## **THE 8 QUALIFIER QUESTIONS**

### **SECTION 1: BASIC INFO** (3 Questions)

**Q1: What's your name?**  
_Text input (First + Last)_

**Q2: What's your email?**  
_Email input_

**Q3: What's your phone number?**  
_Phone input (with country code dropdown)_

---

### **SECTION 2: DIAGNOSTIC** (5 Questions)

**Q4: Which statement feels most true right now?**  
_Single select (required)_

- [ ] I'm succeeding but feel empty  
- [ ] I'm exhausted and my body is breaking down  
- [ ] I'm losing my edge and don't know why  
- [ ] I'm successful but my relationships are suffering  
- [ ] None of these describe me

---

**Q5: What's your biggest constraint right now?**  
_Single select (required)_

- [ ] Time (60+ hour weeks, no capacity)  
- [ ] Energy (always tired, brain fog, low productivity)  
- [ ] Clarity (don't know what's wrong, feeling lost)  
- [ ] Confidence (second-guessing, hesitating, playing defense)  
- [ ] Connection (isolated, relationships suffering)

---

**Q6: What's your annual income?**  
_Single select (required)_

- [ ] $100K-$150K  
- [ ] $150K-$250K  
- [ ] $250K-$500K  
- [ ] $500K-$1M  
- [ ] $1M+  
- [ ] Prefer not to say

**Note**: This helps me understand your constraints and priorities. If you're earning under $150K, The Resurrection may not be the right fit right now (there are more affordable options I can recommend).

---

**Q7: On a scale of 1-10, how ready are you to commit 90 days?**  
_Slider (1 = "Just exploring" → 10 = "I'm all in, let's start now")_

**Note**: There's no wrong answer. If you're at 5-6, that's honest. If you're at 9-10, even better.

---

**Q8: What does success look like 90 days from now?**  
_Text area (2-5 sentences, required)_

**Example**:
> "I'm 25 lbs lighter, sleeping 7 hours/night, working 50 hours/week instead of 75, making sharper decisions, and my wife says she has her husband back."

**Your answer**:  
_Text area (2-5 sentences)_

### **AUTO-REPLY 2: REJECTED (Too Low Income)**

**Subject**: Your Resurrection Strategy Call Application (Alternative Resources)

**Body**:
```
[Name],

Thanks for applying.

Based on your income ($100K-$150K), The Resurrection ($10K investment) is likely a stretch right now.

Here's what I recommend instead:

1. **Free Resource**: Download Protocol Zero (The 48-Hour Reset) → [LINK]

2. **Lower-Cost Option**: Check out [Alternative Coach/Program] → [LINK]

### **AUTO-REPLY 3: REJECTED (Too Low Readiness)**

**Subject**: Your Resurrection Strategy Call Application (Not Ready Yet)

**Body**:
```
[Name],

Thanks for applying.

Based on your readiness score (1-6), it sounds like you're still exploring.

That's okay. But The Resurrection requires full commitment (90 days, daily accountability, 20-30 min/day execution).

If you're not ready—it won't work.

Here's what I recommend instead:

1. **Free Assessment**: Take the System Failure Assessment → [LINK]

2. **Email Sequence**: Get the 5-email series on body-led OS reset → [LINK]

3. **Follow me on LinkedIn**: Watch case studies, frameworks, and content → [LINK]

When you're ready to commit—come back and reapply.

I'll be here.

### **AUTO-REPLY 4: REJECTED (Unclear Goals)**

**Subject**: Your Resurrection Strategy Call Application (Need More Clarity)

**Body**:
```
[Name],

Thanks for applying.

Based on your answers, it looks like you're not sure what success looks like yet.

That's okay. But The Resurrection requires clarity (you need to know what you're reactivating TOWARD).

Here's what I recommend instead:

1. **Free Exercise**: The 90-Day Vision Worksheet → [LINK]

2. **Email Sequence**: Get the 5-email series on purpose calibration → [LINK]

3. **Follow me on LinkedIn**: Watch case studies and frameworks → [LINK]

Once you have clarity on what success looks like 90 days from now—come back and reapply.

I'll be here.
