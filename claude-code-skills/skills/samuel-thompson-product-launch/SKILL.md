# Samuel Thompson - AI Product Launch System

## Overview

Samuel Thompson's methodology treats every business as a "rigged slot machine"—engineering systems that reliably return $1.30 for every $1.00 invested, then feeding that machine as many dollars as possible.

**Core Philosophy**: Radical disposability. Launch fast, validate with real sales, only polish what sells. Any business that stops hitting profitability metrics gets shut down instantly while a new one launches the next day.

## Deployable Capabilities

After using this skill, you can:
1. **Create AI info products** - Generate 100-200 page ebooks in hours
2. **Build conversion-optimized stores** - Deploy Shopify pages that convert 3-5%
3. **Engineer unit economics** - Structure offers for guaranteed profitability
4. **Produce ad creatives** - Generate unlimited test creatives
5. **Detect shadow markets** - Find underserved markets adjacent to massive ones
6. **Validate rapidly** - Test any offer viability within $50-100 ad spend

## Workflow Decision Tree

**What are you trying to do?**

→ **Create a product from scratch**
  - Use [info-product-generator.md](references/prompts/info-product-generator.md)
  
→ **Write store/landing page copy**
  - Use [url-to-copy-builder.md](references/prompts/url-to-copy-builder.md)

→ **Find a market opportunity**
  - Use [shadow-market-detector.md](references/prompts/shadow-market-detector.md)

→ **Create ad creatives**
  - Use [ad-creative-generator.md](references/prompts/ad-creative-generator.md)

→ **Analyze/optimize pricing**
  - Use [unit-economics-analyzer.md](references/prompts/unit-economics-analyzer.md)

→ **Understand the full methodology**
  - Read [genius-patterns.md](references/genius-patterns.md) - 14 patterns decoded
  - Read [hidden-knowledge.md](references/hidden-knowledge.md) - Tacit expertise revealed
  - Read [implementation.md](references/implementation.md) - 24hr/7day/30day pathways

## Quick Start (8-Hour Launch)

1. **Hour 0-2**: Create product using info-product-generator prompt
2. **Hour 2-4**: Build Shopify store, generate copy with url-to-copy-builder
3. **Hour 4-6**: Create 5 ad creatives with ad-creative-generator
4. **Hour 6-8**: Launch $50/day Meta campaign, configure tracking

**Expected Outcome**: Live store with live ads within 8 hours of starting.
