14 executable patterns extracted from Seena Rez's viral content methodology.

## Pattern 1: Hyperdopamine Hook Architecture

**Execute**: Create hooks with simultaneous visual strangeness + distinctive sound + emotional trigger in under 3 seconds. Example: Aging filter (strange visual) + gasp sound (audio) + fear of aging (emotion).

**Success Metric**: 50%+ retention past 3-second mark.

## Pattern 2: PSAEP Sales Framework

**Execute**: Structure every video in exact sequence:
- Problem Hook (0-3 sec): Hyperdopamine format pain identification
- Solution (3-8 sec): Concept introduction
- Authority (8-15 sec): Rapid-fire credibility stacking
- Explanation (15-35 sec): Product demonstration
- Product/CTA (35-45 sec): Direct action step

**Success Metric**: 3%+ click-through rate to profile/link.

---

## Pattern 3: Authority Speed-Stacking

**Execute**: Flash 3-5 authority elements in under 4 seconds—academic study screenshots, celebrity clips, Google search results, statistics. Speed prevents conscious evaluation; creates assumed legitimacy.

**Success Metric**: No viewer comments questioning legitimacy.

---

## Pattern 4: Variation Multiplication Strategy

**Execute**: Create 5+ versions of every concept, changing ONLY the hook (2-3 seconds) while keeping explanation and CTA identical. Post all variations within 48 hours. One hook will statistically outperform by 3-10x.

**Success Metric**: At least 1 variation achieving 10x average view count.

---

## Pattern 5: Strange = Magnetic Philosophy

**Execute**: For every hook, ask: "Is this strange enough to make someone pause?" If it could exist on normal TV, it's not strange enough. Add unusual visuals, unexpected sounds, jarring cuts, cognitive dissonance.

**Success Metric**: First-frame "what is this?" reaction.

---

## Pattern 6: Celebrity Parasocial Leverage

**Execute**: Find 1-2 celebrities who use your product category. Include 2-4 second clips. Position your product as "what they use" or "what they're gatekeeping."

**Success Metric**: Celebrity association mentioned in viewer comments.

---

## Pattern 7: Problem Agitation Through Visualization

**Execute**: Use filters, simulations, or visualizations that make the problem viscerally REAL. Aging filters show the aged face. Decay animations show collagen loss. Worst-case visualizations create immediate emotional response.

**Success Metric**: Strong negative emotional response (fear, disgust, anxiety).

---

## Pattern 8: Science Authority Bridge

**Execute**: Structure as: "[Problem trigger] is based on real science. But you know what's also based on real science? [Solution]." Then flash studies/proof rapidly.

**Success Metric**: Perceived credibility without viewer research.

---

## Pattern 9: Content Quality Confidence

**Execute**: Don't avoid "saturated" product categories—compete on content QUALITY, not product novelty. Your execution style can dominate regardless of competition.

**Success Metric**: Outperforming existing viral content on same product.

---

## Pattern 10: Caption Engineering

**Execute**: Use large, yellow, single-line captions positioned within center safe zone. Break at natural speech pauses. Never more than 7 words per line. Readable at glance.

**Success Metric**: Zero caption readability complaints.

---

## Pattern 11: High Smile Reverse Engineering

**Execute**: Study the #1 brand in hyperdopamine content. Extract their top 10 videos: hook structure, authority placement, explanation technique, CTA format. Apply directly to your product.

**Success Metric**: Structural similarity to billion-dollar brand content.

---

## Pattern 12: Gatekeeping Trigger

**Execute**: Position premium/celebrity solutions as "gatekept" from regular consumers. Then position your product as accessible alternative: "Don't let [celebrities] gatekeep [outcome]. Now you can [achieve result] without [expensive barrier]."

**Success Metric**: Comments expressing "finally accessible" sentiment.

---

## Pattern 13: UGC Explanation Clips

**Execute**: Hooks = highly produced, strange, attention-grabbing. Explanation = simple UGC showing product in use. The contrast creates authenticity while hook carries hyperdopamine load.

**Success Metric**: "Real person" feeling in comments.

---

## Pattern 14: Organic-to-Paid Pipeline

**Execute**: Post 5 variations organically → Wait 24-48 hours → Identify highest performer → Convert to paid ad creative → Scale with advertising budget.

**Success Metric**: Paid ROAS above 3x.
