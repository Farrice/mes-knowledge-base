# Genius Patterns

18 executable patterns from Mitch Albom's 45+ years of storytelling mastery.

---

## Pattern 1: Theme-First Architecture
**Execute**: Before writing anything, articulate your theme in one sentence under 10 words. Then ask: "What character, setting, and plot would make a reader FEEL this truth?"

**Success Metric**: Can you state your theme in under 10 words? Does every major element serve it?

---

## Pattern 2: The Gravedigger Technique
**Execute**: For any large topic, ask: "Who is the gravedigger here?" Find the person on the margins whose small story illuminates the bigger truth.

**Success Metric**: Does your peripheral angle make readers feel the larger theme more powerfully than direct approach?

---

## Pattern 3: Endings-First Navigation
**Execute**: Write your ending first. Then reverse-engineer: "What must happen for this ending to feel earned?"

**Success Metric**: Does your ending create retroactive meaning for everything before it?

---

## Pattern 4: The Tether Principle
**Execute**: Create a tether statement for every project. Before any deviation, ask: "Am I still holding the cord?"

**Success Metric**: Can every scene connect back to your tether in one sentence?

---

## Pattern 5: Character Transformation Mapping
**Execute**: Complete: "My character begins as [state] and ends as [transformed state]." Then design 3-5 beats between them.

**Success Metric**: Would the character at the end make different choices than at the beginning?

---

## Pattern 6: The Uncle vs. Aunt Distinction
**Execute**: When writing, ask: "Am I being the aunt (nitpicky details) or the uncle (action, momentum)?" Cut the aunt passages.

**Success Metric**: Read aloud. Do you feel momentum building or slowing to explain?

---

## Pattern 7: Three-Year-Old Attention Test
**Execute**: Read your work imagining a restless child listening. Where would their eyes glaze?

**Success Metric**: Could your story hold a child's attention (adjusted for vocabulary)?

---

## Pattern 8: First/Last Paragraph Marriage
**Execute**: Write first and last paragraphs together. The last should feel like the inevitable destination of the first.

**Success Metric**: Does reading only first and last give a complete sense of the arc?

---

## Pattern 9: Rhythmic Self-Monitoring
**Execute**: Pay attention to your physical state while writing. Flow forward = working. Tension/stopping = needs adjustment.

**Success Metric**: Are you re-reading the same sentence repeatedly (bad) or flowing forward (good)?

---

## Pattern 10: The Color Wheel Principle
**Execute**: Map emotional register of each scene. If three scenes in same color, insert contrast.

**Success Metric**: Looking at your scene map, do you see emotional variety?

---

## Pattern 11: Slow Parts Fast, Fast Parts Slow
**Execute**: Race through exposition. Linger on emotional peaks. Cut the submarine manual; expand the father carrying his son.

**Success Metric**: Are emotional peaks getting more real estate than setup?

---

## Pattern 12: The Tight Cut
**Execute**: After every draft ask of each sentence: "Does this earn its place?" Remove anything that can be removed.

**Success Metric**: Is every sentence load-bearing?

---

## Pattern 13: Stop Mid-Sentence
**Execute**: When writing is going well, stop mid-sentence. Create eagerness to return. Never stop when stuck.

**Success Metric**: Do you wake up eager to continue?

---

## Pattern 14: The Humility Voice
**Execute**: For profound themes, ask: "What about this makes me feel small?" Write from wonder rather than authority.

**Success Metric**: Does your prose sound like someone marveling or lecturing?

---

## Pattern 15: 98% for Readers
**Execute**: Before committing to any element, ask: "Am I adding this for ME or for READERS?"

**Success Metric**: Would your target reader miss this element if it were gone?

---

## Pattern 16: The Derek Redmond Radar
**Execute**: In any situation, actively scan the periphery: "What's the human story everyone else is missing?"

**Success Metric**: Is your angle the same as everyone else's?

---

## Pattern 17: Deadline Immunity
**Execute**: Set non-negotiable deadlines. Show up daily regardless of "feeling like it." Block comes from optional writing.

**Success Metric**: Have you written today, regardless of mood?

---

## Pattern 18: The Book Idea Archive
**Execute**: Create a capture system for ideas. Tag consistently. Review monthly. Mine archive instead of brainstorming.

**Success Metric**: Do you have more ideas waiting than you could execute in five years?
