# Hidden Knowledge

10 tacit expertise points Mitch Albom knows but didn't explicitly teach—now deployable.

---

## 1. The Body Knows Before the Mind
Albom rocks back and forth when writing works; stops when it doesn't. Your physical state is a more reliable indicator of writing quality than intellectual assessment.

**Deploy**: Before editing intellectually, notice how your body feels reading it. Discomfort = reader discomfort.

---

## 2. Humility Unlocks Different Language
Adopting a posture of humility—feeling small before creation—literally changes the words that emerge. "You use a different language when you marvel at something."

**Deploy**: For profound themes, spend 5 minutes feeling genuine awe before writing. Ask: "What about this makes me feel small?"

---

## 3. Loss of Love vs. Loss of Life
Loss of love while the person is still present is distinct from death—arguably more painful. Yearning for someone who exists but no longer feels the same.

**Deploy**: When writing about loss, specify which type: presence (death), feeling (love gone), or possibility (paths not taken).

---

## 4. The Flame Framework for Love Stories
The "combustible" part (how flames ignite) vs. the "nurturing" part (keeping the flame alive). Nearly all love stories focus on combustion. The nurturing space is wide open.

**Deploy**: Ask: "Am I writing combustion or nurturing?" Sustained love is unexplored territory.

## 5. Children Are Better Test Audiences
Adults will be polite about boring writing. Children show it in their eyes immediately. This isn't about dumbing down—it's about narrative compulsion.

**Deploy**: Read your work imagining a restless child. Where would they interrupt? Where zone out?

---

## 6. The Newspaper First Paragraph Discipline
Journalism taught that first paragraphs must earn place within seconds. But more importantly: make first and last paragraphs "work together" as a frame.

**Deploy**: Draft first and last paragraphs together before filling the middle.

---

## 7. Small Books Are Earned, Not Chosen
"Tuesdays with Morrie" is small because Albom couldn't write flowery prose about death. The constraint became signature. Limitations you accept become styles readers love.

**Deploy**: Identify your limitations honestly. Lean into them as stylistic signatures.

---

## 8. Reading Aloud Reveals Rhythm Errors
Albom reads his books to his wife before submission. Reading aloud reveals problems silent reading misses. The voice catches rhythm breaks the eye skips.

**Deploy**: Read every important piece aloud. Where you stumble, readers stumble.

---

## 9. The "God File" Principle
Albom's rabbi had a file labeled "God" with decades of notes. "What is God if not a series of questions and the answers we believe we're hearing?"

**Deploy**: For profound topics, keep a file—not conclusions, but questions. The file IS the journey.

---

## 10. Passion ≠ Commercial Viability
Albom loves doo-wop music but won't write about it—can't make it interesting to readers. Ruthlessly separate personal interest from reader interest.

**Deploy**: For every idea, ask separately: (1) Does this interest me? (2) Does this serve readers? Only proceed when both are yes.
