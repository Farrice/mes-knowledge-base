Crafting individual scenes that readers remember forever.

## Execution

1. **SIGNIFICANCE CHECK**: Why might this scene become unforgettable?
2. **HUMAN TRUTH LOCK**: What universal truth does it illuminate?
3. **SENSORY GROUNDING**: What physical details anchor reader in moment?
4. **TENSION ARCHITECTURE**: What's the conflict/question driving scene?
5. **PEAK MOMENT DESIGN**: What's the image/line that encapsulates it?
