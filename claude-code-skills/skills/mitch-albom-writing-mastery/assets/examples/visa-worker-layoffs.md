## Gravedigger Selected: The H-1B Visa Worker

**Why**: For visa workers, layoffs are existential. They can't "take time to figure out what's next." They have 60 days to find a new sponsor or uproot their entire lives—children, homes, relationships, community.

## Opening

The email arrived at 4:47 PM Pacific, which was 6:17 AM in Bangalore, where Priya's mother was making tea and wouldn't understand, when she heard, why her daughter was crying.

Priya Sharma had given Nexus Technologies eight years. She'd given them her twenties, her first gray hairs, her wedding anniversary last March when the product launch couldn't be moved. She'd given them the version of herself that could stay awake for 72 hours during incidents, the version that missed her father's last Diwali because flights were expensive and PTO was precious and there would always be next year. There wasn't.

In return, Nexus Technologies had given her a visa.

Not a career. Not a future. A permission slip. A temporary authorization to exist in the country where her children were born, where her husband had just started a small business, where they'd bought a house in Cupertino with a mortgage that would take 30 years to pay.

The email said she had 60 days.

## Key Beat: The 60-Day Clock

She started applying that night. LinkedIn was already flooded—12,000 people suddenly looking, all of them with the same story, most with the same desperation. But not all of them with the same clock.

An American colleague, also laid off, posted about "taking some time for self-care." He was going to hike, reflect, maybe finally write that novel. Priya double-clicked a job that required relocation to Texas, where she knew no one, because knowing no one was better than knowing everyone from the window of a departing plane.

Day 8: A startup showed interest. They'd never sponsored a visa before.
Day 12: They decided sponsorship was "too complicated."
Day 23: Arjun asked why Mommy was always on the computer now.

## Closing

On day 57, the Seattle company confirmed her visa transfer was approved. She cried in her car in the Safeway parking lot.

She kept the Nexus keycard. Maybe as proof that she had belonged somewhere once. Maybe as a reminder that belonging, in America, required a sponsor.

On the flight to Seattle, Arjun asked if they could come back someday.

"Maybe," Priya said.

He fell asleep against her shoulder, six years old, American-born, dreaming of a home that was already being painted over.

**What makes this exceptional**:
- Transforms business story into existential one
- 60-day countdown creates inherent urgency
- Specific details (Arjun's NASA room) create emotional reality
- Final paragraph doesn't resolve—illuminates ongoing precarity
