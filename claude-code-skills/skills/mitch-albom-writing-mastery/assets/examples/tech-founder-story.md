## Ending Scene

Sarah stood in the empty office at 2 AM, the same office where six years ago she'd slept on an air mattress, too broke to afford both rent and runway. The acquisition had closed that afternoon. Five hundred and twelve million dollars. Her phone hadn't stopped buzzing—congratulations from people she barely knew.

She walked to the window. Below, the city sparkled with the lives of people who would wake up tomorrow and go to jobs they complained about, then come home to families who expected them for dinner. She had optimized away every inefficiency in her life. Dinner with her mother—inefficient. Her college friends—inefficient. David, who'd asked her to marry him three years ago—catastrophically inefficient.

She'd built a machine so perfect it no longer needed her.

Her finger hovered over David's contact. Three years of silence. What would she even say? *I won. I finally won. And I would trade every dollar to feel what I felt when we used to cook terrible pasta in your studio apartment and talk about what we'd do "someday."*

The cursor blinked. She closed the phone.

Someday had come. Someday had gone. Someday had cost $512 million and was still overpriced.

## Opening Scene

The term sheet arrived at 3:47 AM, because that's when Hong Kong wakes up. Sarah read it twice, then a third time, her finger scrolling past zeros like a meditation. Five hundred and twelve million dollars.

She should call someone. That's what people did with news like this—they called someone. But her contact list was a graveyard of efficiency. Her co-founder had left two years ago, burned out. Her assistant was an AI that scheduled better than any human. Her mother wouldn't understand, and even if she did, wouldn't remember by morning.

Sarah poured a glass of the whiskey she kept for investors and raised it to the empty room. "To someday," she said.

The word echoed off walls that had heard a thousand pitches, a hundred pivots, three board coups, and exactly zero conversations about anything that didn't compound.

She'd spent six years turning herself into the kind of person who could build a $512 million company. She'd succeeded completely.

The whiskey tasted like victory. Victory tasted like nothing at all.
