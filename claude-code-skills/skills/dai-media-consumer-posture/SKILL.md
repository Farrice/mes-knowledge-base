# Dai Media - Consumer Posture Framework

## Overview

Dai Media's Consumer Posture framework rejects demographics entirely in favor of understanding individual consumers at the deepest psychological level. The core insight: **People don't buy to solve problems anymore—they buy to access feelings.**

**Core Philosophy**: Brands are living systems. The consumer is the heartbeat. Understanding ONE real individual deeply is infinitely more valuable than understanding a demographic group loosely.

## Deployable Capabilities

After using this skill, you can:
1. **Build Consumer Posture Profiles** - Three-dimensional individual analysis
2. **Find Individual Consumers** - Locate real, findable people who embody ideal customers
3. **Diagnose Understanding Gaps** - The "stunned brand owner" 25-question audit
4. **Design Emotional Outcome Sales** - Sales built on feelings, not features
5. **Craft Internal World Stories** - Narratives set inside the consumer's head
6. **Engineer Anti-Groupthink Virality** - Spread through individual resonance
7. **Decode Consumer Signals** - Read individual behavior for strategic intelligence
8. **Apply The Row Method** - Premium positioning through mystique
9. **Integrate All Systems** - Force multiply across frameworks

## Workflow Decision Tree

**What are you trying to do?**

→ **Understand your ideal consumer deeply**
  - Use [consumer-posture-generator.md](references/prompts/consumer-posture-generator.md)

→ **Find a real person who represents your consumer**
  - Use [individual-consumer-finder.md](references/prompts/individual-consumer-finder.md)

→ **Audit how well you know your consumer**
  - Use [consumer-gap-diagnostic.md](references/prompts/consumer-gap-diagnostic.md)

→ **Build sales process around emotions**
  - Use [emotional-outcome-sales.md](references/prompts/emotional-outcome-sales.md)

→ **Create content that makes people feel seen**
  - Use [internal-world-storytelling.md](references/prompts/internal-world-storytelling.md)

→ **Engineer viral content without trend-chasing**
  - Use [anti-groupthink-viral.md](references/prompts/anti-groupthink-viral.md)

→ **Read consumer behavior for strategic insights**
  - Use [signal-intelligence-decoder.md](references/prompts/signal-intelligence-decoder.md)

→ **Position as premium/luxury brand**
  - Use [row-method-creative.md](references/prompts/row-method-creative.md)

→ **Combine multiple approaches**
  - Use [force-multiplier-system.md](references/prompts/force-multiplier-system.md)

→ **Understand the full methodology**
  - Read [genius-patterns.md](references/genius-patterns.md) - 14 patterns decoded
  - Read [hidden-knowledge.md](references/hidden-knowledge.md) - 5 tacit knowledge points
  - Read [implementation.md](references/implementation.md) - 24hr/7day/30day pathways

## Quick Start (24 Hours)

1. **Hour 0-2**: Identify ONE real individual who represents your ideal consumer
2. **Hour 2-4**: Complete Consumer Posture for that individual (Occupation/Activity/Thought Process)
3. **Hour 4-8**: Audit your last 10 pieces of content—does each speak to the individual or the group?
4. **Hour 8-12**: Rewrite positioning to speak to identity aspirations, not demographics
5. **Hour 12-24**: Create 3 pieces of Internal World content that articulate what consumers can't say

**Expected Outcome**: Complete individual-first consumer foundation enabling resonant content.
