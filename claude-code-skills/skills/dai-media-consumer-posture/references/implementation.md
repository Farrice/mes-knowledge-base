# Implementation Pathways

Structured timelines for deploying Dai Media's Consumer Posture methodology.

---

## 24-Hour Quickstart

**Hour 0-2**: Watch the original Dai Media content twice. On first viewing, absorb. On second viewing, note every specific example (The Row, Kristen Stewart, stunned brand owners).

**Hour 2-4**: Identify ONE real individual who represents your ideal consumer. Not a persona. A real, findable person.

**Hour 4-8**: Complete quick Consumer Posture sketch:
- Occupation: What role do they play in my brand's world?
- Activity: What rituals and routines reinforce their identity?
- Thought Process: What logic drives their choices?

**Hour 8-12**: Audit your last 10 pieces of content. For each: "Does this speak to an individual or a group?"

**Hour 12-24**: Rewrite your brand's positioning statement to speak to individual identity aspirations, not demographic characteristics.
