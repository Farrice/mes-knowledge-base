# Consumer Posture Sample: MATTE & CO

Example output from Consumer Posture Generator.

---

## The Individual

Her name is something like Sara. She's 34, but that number means nothing—she could be 28 or 41. She works in a field requiring visual judgment: UX design, architecture, brand strategy. Not famous, but respected by people whose respect matters.

Her apartment contains approximately 60% fewer objects than her neighbors'. This isn't minimalism as aesthetic—it's minimalism as relief.

## Occupation in Your World

Sara's role in the MATTE & CO world is **The Curator Who Has Stopped Curating**.

She spent years searching, considering, comparing. She developed an eye most people don't know exists. This eye is a burden—it makes most stores exhausting, most products irritating.

What makes MATTE & CO's world tick is Sara's RELIEF. She's found a brand that pre-curates to her standards. The trust is complete.

## Activity in Your World

**Morning ritual**: The kettle. The pour takes 3 minutes. She doesn't check her phone during these 3 minutes. This is the only time in her day when nothing is optimized.

**Purchasing behavior**: She buys replacements, not additions. Acquisition is maintenance, not entertainment.

**Identity reinforcement**: Every MATTE & CO object whispers: "You were right. Your standards weren't too high."

## Thought Process

**Internal logic**: "Most things are poorly designed. I notice. I care. My environment should reflect my standards."

**What feels aligned**: Restraint. Intention. Materials that age beautifully.

**What she's refusing**: The accumulation treadmill. The cognitive tax of "almost right."

## The Posture Synthesis

Sara sits up STRAIGHT in MATTE & CO. Not rigid—relaxed, but aligned. Her posture says: "I know what I want. I have it. I'm not searching anymore."

## Strategic Implications

**Content**: Don't sell. Show objects in use. Show them lasting. Show the silence of a kitchen where everything works.

**Voice**: Quiet. Undefended. No "we believe" statements.

**What NOT to do**: Influencer campaigns. Community building. Anything that asks Sara to perform her relationship with the brand.
