## Validation Criteria

Research is ready for profile generation when:

| Criterion | Requirement |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Currency** | Sources within 6-12 months |
| **Specificity** | Real quotes or behaviors, not generalizations |
| **Tension** | Clear picture of what consumer is rejecting |
| **Confirmation** | Multiple sources supporting key insights |

## Research Red Flags

Stop and gather more if you see:
- Only finding generic industry reports
- No real customer voice/language
- Can't articulate what they're refusing
- Insights feel like they could apply to anyone

## Quick Research Prompts

Use these search patterns:
- `"[brand category]" reddit honest review`
- `"why I switched from [competitor]"`
- `"[product type]" "finally found" OR "been looking for"`
