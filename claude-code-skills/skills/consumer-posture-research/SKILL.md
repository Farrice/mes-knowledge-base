# Consumer Posture Research

## Overview

This skill produces **Consumer Posture Profiles**—deep psychological portraits of the ONE individual who makes a brand world tick. Unlike demographic personas, Consumer Posture reveals:

- **Occupation**: How they occupy space in your brand world
- **Activity**: Behaviors that reinforce their identity  
- **Thought Process**: Internal logic driving every choice

The goal: a portrait so specific that the consumer would feel genuinely SEEN if they read it.

## Workflow

1. **Gather brand context** → Understand brand essence, category, signals
2. **Research current market** → Validate with real-time web search
3. **Generate Consumer Posture Profile** → Follow framework in references/
4. **Extract strategic implications** → Content, voice, product, experience
5. **Create prediction tests** → Validate profile utility

## Input Requirements

Before generating a profile, gather:

| Input | Description | Required |
|-------|-------------|----------|
| Brand Name | The brand being profiled | ✓ |
| Brand Category | Industry/product category | ✓ |
| Brand Essence | 2-3 sentences: what it stands for, vibe, world | ✓ |
| Consumer Signals | Existing insights, successful customers, intuitions | Optional |

## Execution Steps

### Step 1: Research Phase

Before profiling, conduct current research:
- Search for recent discussions about similar brands/products
- Look for customer reviews, testimonials, community discussions
- Identify behavioral patterns and language used by potential customers
- Note what they're rejecting from alternatives

See [research-checklist.md](references/research-checklist.md) for validation criteria.

### Step 2: Generate Profile

Follow the complete methodology in [consumer-posture-framework.md](references/consumer-posture-framework.md).

Core principle: **Reject demographic framing.** Age, income, gender tell you nothing about who this individual IS.

The profile must include:
1. **The Individual** - Vivid description of ONE person
2. **Occupation in Your World** - Their role, energy, what makes the brand world tick
3. **Activity in Your World** - Rituals, routines, identity-reinforcing behaviors
4. **Thought Process in Your World** - Internal logic, alignments, refusals
5. **The Posture Synthesis** - How they "sit up" in your brand
6. **Strategic Implications** - Content, voice, products, experience decisions
7. **The Prediction Test** - 5 hypothetical brand decisions with predicted responses

### Step 3: Output Deliverable

**Format**: Structured prose, 1500-2000 words
**Quality Standard**: Profile enables confident prediction of consumer behavior in novel situations

See [output-templates.md](references/output-templates.md) for structure and examples.

## Creative Latitude

Apply full intuitive judgment. The framework is foundation, but creative intelligence makes the person VIVID and REAL. Go beyond generic descriptors—find:
- Unexpected choices
- Subtle contradictions
- Precise emotional texture of their existence

Where brand essence suggests nuances not stated, explore them. Where signals hint at deeper psychology, pursue it.
