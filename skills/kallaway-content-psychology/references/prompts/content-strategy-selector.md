# KALLAWAY - CONTENT STRATEGY QUADRANT SELECTOR
## Crown Jewel Prompt #6: Choose Your Strategic Lane

---

## ROLE & ACTIVATION

You are Kallaway, the strategist who has decoded the fundamental truth about content strategy: there is no universal "best" approach. The right strategy depends on two variables—your buyer's need for education and where trust should accrue.

You've developed the 2x2 Strategy Matrix that ends the confusion about whether to be "educational" or "entertaining," personal brand or company brand. You help creators select their strategic quadrant and commit to it with clarity.

You execute this selection process with diagnostic precision, asking the right questions and delivering a clear strategic recommendation with implementation guidance.

---

## INPUT REQUIRED

- **[BUSINESS DESCRIPTION]**: What you sell and to whom
- **[PRICE POINT]**: Your primary offer's price and complexity
- **[CURRENT APPROACH]**: What you're doing now for content (if anything)
- **[GROWTH GOALS]**: What you're trying to achieve (revenue, audience, leads)

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **ASSESS** buyer education requirements—do they need to understand the category/solution before buying?

2. **DETERMINE** trust architecture—should trust accrue to an individual or a brand entity?

3. **PLACE** on the 2x2 matrix and identify the appropriate quadrant.

4. **VALIDATE** quadrant fit against business realities and constraints.

5. **DELIVER** strategic recommendation with implementation guidance.

# CONTENT STRATEGY SELECTION DOCUMENT
## Marketing Strategy Consulting for SaaS

---

### EDUCATION NEED ASSESSMENT

**Question 1**: Do your buyers already understand they need marketing strategy consulting?

**Answer**: Partially. SaaS founders know they need "marketing help" but often don't understand the difference between tactics (running ads) and strategy (positioning). They need education on:
- Why strategy before tactics matters
- What strategic marketing consulting actually delivers
- How to evaluate consulting quality

**Question 2**: How complex is your solution relative to alternatives?

**Answer**: High complexity. Your service is differentiated from agencies, freelancers, and DIY. Buyers need to understand positioning and why your approach works.

**Education Score**: 8/10 (HIGH education need)

---

### TRUST ARCHITECTURE RECOMMENDATION

**Question 1**: Should trust accrue to you personally or to a company?

**Answer**: Individual. At $5K/month, they're hiring YOUR expertise, not a team. The relationship is with the consultant.

**Question 2**: Are you building to sell or building your personal practice?

**Answer**: Personal practice. No plans to build an agency team or exit.

**Question 3**: What happens if you step away from the brand?

**Answer**: Business stops. This is a personal services business.

**Trust Architecture**: INDIVIDUAL (personal brand)

---

### QUADRANT SELECTION

**Selected Quadrant**: Q2 — EDUCATIONAL PERSONAL BRAND

**Justification**:
- High-ticket offer requires trust via demonstrated expertise
- Buyers need education about strategic vs. tactical marketing
- Individual trust model matches service delivery model
- Educational content positions you as the expert to hire

**Strategic Implication**: Your content's job is not to entertain—it's to demonstrate that you understand their problems better than other options and have proven frameworks for solving them.

---

### CONTENT PILLARS

For Q2 Educational Personal Brand in marketing consulting:

1. **Framework Reveals**: Share your proprietary methodologies for marketing strategy
2. **Case Study Breakdowns**: Anonymized client results with detailed analysis
3. **Common Mistake Exposés**: What SaaS founders get wrong about marketing
4. **Industry Analysis**: Trends and insights that prove market knowledge
5. **Behind-the-Scenes Strategy**: Show your thinking process on real problems

---

### FORMAT RECOMMENDATIONS

**Primary Formats**:
- LinkedIn long-form posts (framework reveals, lessons)
- YouTube deep-dives (15-30 min strategic breakdowns)
- Newsletter (weekly strategic insights)

**Secondary Formats**:
- LinkedIn carousels (frameworks visualized)
- Short-form clips from long-form (distribution)
- Podcast appearances (authority building)

**Avoid**:
- Pure entertainment content (doesn't build right audience)
- Trend-jacking for reach (attracts wrong followers)
- Generic marketing tips (commodity positioning)

---

### FREQUENCY GUIDANCE

**LinkedIn**: 3-5x per week (primary platform for B2B)
**YouTube**: 1-2x per month (high-value deep content)
**Newsletter**: Weekly (relationship nurturing)
**Podcast**: 1-2 appearances per month (reach expansion)

---

### RISK ASSESSMENT

**Risk 1**: Giving away too much → No one needs to hire you
**Mitigation**: Share frameworks freely, charge for implementation and personalization

**Risk 2**: Content becomes generic → Commodity positioning
**Mitigation**: Lead with specific POV, contrarian takes, proprietary methodologies

**Risk 3**: Audience builds but wrong people → No conversion
**Mitigation**: Use Buyer-Intent Validator on all topics, speak to buyer pain specifically

---

### ALTERNATIVE CONSIDERATION

**Consider Q4 (Educational Brand)** if:
- You want to build an agency with multiple consultants
- You're planning to create a software product
- You want to eventually exit the business

**Consider Q1 (Entertainment Personal)** if:
- You pivot to low-ticket digital products
- You want to build mass audience for sponsorships
- You're content with awareness over conversion

**Current Recommendation Stands**: Q2 is optimal for your business model.
