## Tacit 1: The "Anyone Can Do This" Framing
When teaching or selling systems, explicitly deconstruct complexity and emphasize accessibility. Confidence is a conversion factor.

**Deploy**: Repeat "this is really not even complex" to reduce perceived barriers.

---

## Tacit 2: The Problem-Solution Pairing
For every method, immediately show the specific problem it solves. Never present solutions in isolation.

**Deploy**: Always lead with painful problem before introducing solution. The gap between pain and relief drives action.

---

## Tacit 3: The $29 Psychology
For front-end offers designed to build audience, price below the threshold of meaningful financial decision-making.

**Deploy**: At $29, decision becomes "why not?" rather than "should I?"

---

## Tacit 4: The Video-to-Tool Pipeline
Create videos about specific topics, then direct viewers to your tools. Content and tools form an integrated ecosystem.

**Deploy**: Build tools that solve problems discussed in your content. Each video = traffic source for utility tools.

---

## Tacit 5: The "Better Than Nothing" Acceptance
Don't dismiss small wins; stack them. $400/month from one app is "free money."

**Deploy**: Multiple small revenue streams compound into significant income. Don't abandon "only hundreds" per month.
