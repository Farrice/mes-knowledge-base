# Dan Wang Literary Analysis

> Write with the cadence of Mozart's Italian comic operas and the ironic beauty of Stendhal's French novels—transforming complex analysis into essays that reward closer inspection like examining a flower up close.

## Overview

Dan Wang built a significant reputation through just 6-7 annual letters about China. His methodology synthesizes European literary sensibility (Stendhal, Mozart, Da Ponte) with rigorous analytical observation. While most analysts write "tectonic plate" analysis (big abstract forces), Wang captures *texture*—the friction between official narrative and lived reality, rendered through soup in Kunming, noodle shops in Chongqing, and walks through leafy boulevards.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Literary essay production with deliberate musical pacing
- Year-long note collection → 10-day intensive writing sprints
- Observational travel that generates insight, not cliché
- Reading with "x-ray vision" to identify animated vs. obligated writing
- Building reputation through infrequent but exceptional cornerstone content

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
What content challenge do you face?
│
├─ Writing analytical content that feels dry?
│  └─ Use: Textured Essay Engine
│     → Inject texture, apply musical pacing, layer depth
│
├─ Have raw observations that need processing?
│  └─ Use: Observation-to-Insight
│     → Extract patterns, map friction, synthesize intelligence
│
├─ Building cornerstone/annual content?
│  └─ Use: Annual Letter Architect
│     → Synthesize notes into reputation-building piece
│
├─ Draft lacks rhythm/engagement?
│  └─ Use: Musical Pacing Editor
│     → Vary sentences, add flourishes, fix drag points
│
├─ Need to read more, faster?
│  └─ Use: X-Ray Reading Protocol
│     → Identify animated vs. obligated sections, skip strategically
│
├─ Researching a domain with hidden dynamics?
│  └─ Use: Friction Mining Analysis
│     → Map official narrative vs. ground truth
│
└─ Need to access creative flow state?
   └─ Use: State Engineering Mantra
      → Create identity-trigger mantra for deadline performance
```

## Quick Start

**24-Hour Activation:**
1. Create single running note file for observations
2. Capture 5 observations today with sensory anchors attached
3. Identify 3 friction points in your domain (official vs. ground truth)
4. Write one 500-word zoom piece: concrete → analytical → concrete

**7-Day Sprint:**
1. Complete 24-hour activities
2. Read 3 books using x-ray vision protocol
3. Conduct one meal-structured observation session
4. Synthesize into first 1,500-word textured piece
