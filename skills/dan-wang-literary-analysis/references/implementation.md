# Dan Wang - Implementation Pathway

## 24-Hour Quickstart

**Hour 0-2: System Setup**
- Create single running note file for observations
- Capture 5 observations from today with sensory anchors attached
- Identify 3 friction points in your domain (official vs. ground truth)

**Hour 2-6: First Collection Sprint**
- Go somewhere relevant to your domain
- Structure movement around 2 destinations with walking between
- Capture everything—sentences, observations, questions, fragments
- Add at least one "great sentence that drifted into mind"

**Hour 6-12: Craft Study**
- Select one exceptional piece in your target form
- Begin score-copying exercise (complete at least 500 words)
- Note 5 specific craft choices you'd never consciously noticed

**Hour 12-24: First Output**
- Write one 500-word zoom piece: concrete → analytical → concrete
- Read it aloud; mark rhythm issues
- Add to note file with reflection

**Deliverable**: Note system established, first observation session completed, one practice piece written.

## 7-Day Sprint

**Days 1-2: Foundation**
- Complete 24-hour activities
- Finish full score-copy with annotations
- Build friction map to 10+ points
- Note file: 50+ entries

**Days 3-4: Observation Engine**
- Complete meal-structured exploration day
- Read 3 books using x-ray vision protocol
- Write 2 more zoom-oscillation pieces
- Question bank: 15+ entries

**Days 5-6: Synthesis Practice**
- Review notes; identify 2-3 throughlines
- Find best sentence; attempt building outward
- Analyze 2 books for genre conventions
- Try one irony-layered rewrite

**Day 7: First Cornerstone**
