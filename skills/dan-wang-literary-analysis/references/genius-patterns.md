# Dan Wang - Genius Patterns

## Pattern 1: Musical Sentence Architecture
**Execute**: Construct sentences with cadence variation—short punchy statements followed by flowing complex ones. Add "flourishes" (unexpected word choices, surprising metaphors) at rhythmic intervals.

**Success Metric**: Reader describes the *experience* of reading as pleasurable, not just informative.

---

## Pattern 2: The Flower Inspection Principle
**Execute**: Layer meaning at multiple depths—surface insight for scanners, deeper patterns for close readers, Easter eggs for re-readers.

**Success Metric**: Readers return to the same piece; it rewards re-reading.

---

## Pattern 3: Texture Over Tectonic Plates
**Execute**: Start analytical points with specific observed details. Use a meal, a walk, a conversation as the gateway to the big idea.

**Success Metric**: Reader remembers the concrete detail AND the analytical point together.

---

## Pattern 4: Formal/Informal Friction Mining
**Execute**: Map the "official story" vs. the "ground truth"—the friction between them IS the story.

**Success Metric**: Insights that others miss because they only read official sources.

---

## Pattern 5: Year-Long Note Accumulation → Sprint Production
**Execute**: Maintain a single running note file. Dump insights as they occur. Let the deadline force synthesis in a 10-day intensive sprint.

**Success Metric**: Output feels both spontaneous AND deeply considered.

---

## Pattern 6: The Single Beautiful Sentence Method
**Execute**: When a great sentence arrives, capture it immediately. Consider building the piece around it rather than fitting it in.

**Success Metric**: Readers quote your sentences back to you.

---

## Pattern 7: Outsider Error-Correction
**Execute**: Identify where you're an outsider. Use that distance to see dysfunctions that insiders normalize.

**Success Metric**: Elite insiders find your observations both uncomfortable and accurate.

---

## Pattern 8: The Zoom In/Zoom Out Oscillation
**Execute**: After every concrete detail, elevate to what it means. After every abstract point, ground it in specifics.

**Success Metric**: Piece works for both casual readers and domain experts.

---

## Pattern 9: Meal-Structured Travel
**Execute**: Organize exploration days around 3-4 eateries, walking between them to generate observations. The walking is where insight happens.

**Success Metric**: Return with notes full of observations, not just photos.

---

## Pattern 10: X-Ray Vision Reading
**Execute**: Ask "Did the author WANT to write this section or HAVE to?" Skip obligated sections, study animated ones.

**Success Metric**: Read 3x more books with equal or better comprehension.

---

## Pattern 11: The Qualm-Collected-Canadian Mantra
**Execute**: Create a personal identity mantra embodying your ideal working state. Repeat it when resistance appears.

**Success Metric**: Meet deadlines without quality collapse.

---

## Pattern 12: Genre Transcendence Identification
**Execute**: Learn the structural incentives of each publishing format. Seek work that escapes those constraints.

**Success Metric**: Reading list consists of exceptional work, not genre-typical work.

---

## Pattern 13: Ironic Beauty Layering
**Execute**: Write beautiful sentences that, upon reflection, contain tension or irony. Don't be surface-earnest.

**Success Metric**: Readers discover new meanings on re-reading.

---

## Pattern 14: Score-Copying Apprenticeship
**Execute**: Select masterwork in your target form. Manually copy it word-by-word to internalize choices.

**Success Metric**: Begin making intentional choices you previously made unconsciously.

---

## Pattern 15: The Network Effects of Knowledge
**Execute**: Reject the depreciation model of knowledge. Invest in learning breadth to accelerate future learning.
