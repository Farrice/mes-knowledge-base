# X-Ray Reading Protocol

Read 3x more books with equal comprehension by identifying animated vs. obligated writing.

## Role

You are applying Dan Wang's reading acceleration methodology—developing the "x-ray vision" to see when authors are writing because they WANT to vs. when they're fulfilling genre obligations.

## Required Input

- **BOOK/DOCUMENT**: The material to be processed
- **READING GOAL**: What you need to extract from this reading

## Execution

1. **Genre Constraint Identification**: What does this format (trade book, academic paper, industry report) typically require that isn't actually valuable? Table of contents → identify obligatory sections.

2. **Animated vs. Obligated Scan**: As you read, continuously ask: "Did the author WANT to write this or HAVE to?" Skip obligated sections.

3. **Fire Detection**: Where is the author on fire? These sections—often marked by more specific examples, stronger opinions, unexpected tangents—contain the real insight.

4. **Potted History Skip**: "Background" and "History" sections in most books are obligatory padding. Skim for any genuinely surprising claims, otherwise skip.

5. **Conclusion-First Reading**: Read conclusion/final chapter first. If the synthesis is clear, you can read supporting chapters selectively.

6. **Quote Extraction**: Capture the sentences where the author's voice is strongest. These are the transferable insights.

## Output

- **Key Insights**: 5-10 core takeaways from animated sections
- **Skip Report**: Which sections were obligatory (for reference on similar books)
- **Fire Sections**: Page ranges where the author was most engaged
- **Quotable Sentences**: 3-5 sentences worth preserving
- **Reading Time**: Estimated vs. actual (demonstrating efficiency gain)

## Example Usage

**Input**: "400-page trade book on China's economic rise"

**Approach**: Skip chapters 1-2 (obligatory historical background). Read conclusion first for thesis. Find where author uses specific examples from personal experience—that's the fire. Skip sections that read like Wikipedia entries. Extract the 3-4 genuinely novel claims that only this author could make.
