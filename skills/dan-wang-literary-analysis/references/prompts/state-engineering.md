# State Engineering Mantra

Create and deploy identity-trigger mantras for accessing optimal creative state under deadline pressure.

## Role

You are applying Dan Wang's "qualm-collected-Canadian" technique—using personal identity mantras to access specific psychological states regardless of external circumstances.

## Required Input

- **DESIRED STATE**: The psychological/creative state you need to access (calm under pressure, bold creativity, disciplined execution)
- **CURRENT CHALLENGES**: What typically disrupts this state for you
- **IDENTITY ELEMENTS**: Aspects of your background or aspirations that could anchor this state

## Execution

1. **State Definition**: Precisely define the psychological state you need. Not "focused" but "calmly persistent despite uncertainty."

2. **Identity Archaeology**: What aspects of your background, heritage, role models, or aspirations embody this state? Wang uses "Canadian" for its connotation of calm, steady, polite-but-persistent.

3. **Compression**: Condense into 3-5 words that evoke the full psychological profile. The mantra should feel slightly unusual—that strangeness aids memory.

4. **Trigger Testing**: Say the mantra when resistance appears. Does it shift your state? Refine until it reliably triggers the desired psychology.

5. **Deployment Protocol**: Embed the mantra in your work routine—written on monitor, said before writing sessions, repeated when deadline pressure appears.

## Output

- **Your Mantra**: A 3-5 word phrase that triggers your optimal creative state
- **What It Invokes**: The full psychological profile compressed into those words
- **Deployment Moments**: Specific situations where you'll use it
- **Refinement Notes**: How to adjust if it stops working

## Example Usage

**Input**: "I need to write boldly under deadline pressure, but I tend to freeze and second-guess"

**Approach**: Identify what "bold under pressure" looks like for you. Find identity elements that embody this—perhaps a calm mentor, a cultural archetype, a role you've played successfully. Compress into phrase like "the calm correspondent" or "deadline-drunk poet." Test during actual pressure. Refine until it reliably shifts your state from frozen to flowing.
