## Tacit 1: The 85% Satisfaction Ceiling
Writers are never more than 85% satisfied with their work. This isn't failure—it's the nature of craft.

**Deploy**: Accept 85% as success threshold. Ship when you reach it. Perfectionism kills cornerstone content.

## Tacit 2: Deadline as Synthesis Forcing Function
The hasty 10-day sprint isn't a bug—it's a feature. Deadlines force synthesis of accumulated notes that would otherwise remain fragmented.

**Deploy**: Set artificial deadlines for synthesis. Haste creates coherence that deliberation cannot.

---

## Tacit 3: Writing Retreats as Environmental Variation
Varying writing locations (Austin, Vietnam, Barcelona, home) prevents staleness and creates associative diversity.

**Deploy**: Change location for different writing phases. The barbecue eaten while writing becomes part of the creative substrate.

---

## Tacit 4: Mom-Level Feedback Value
Family members with relevant expertise provide feedback that professional contacts won't give. Uncomfortable but invaluable.

**Deploy**: Seek feedback from people who'll be honest because they love you, not because they're paid to.

---

## Tacit 5: AI as Tyler-in-Your-Pocket
Use AI as a conversation partner for thinking through—music, novels, art, restaurant recommendations. Not for generating sentences, but for intellectual sparring.

**Deploy**: AI augments cognition; human provides voice. Never use AI for sentence generation in craft writing.

---

## Tacit 6: Visa Uncertainty as Editorial Freedom
By accepting he may not get another China visa, Wang freed himself to write honestly. Willingness to lose access enables better access to truth.

**Deploy**: Identify what you're afraid to lose. Accept losing it. Write from that freedom.

---

## Tacit 7: The Cover Photo Strategy
Reject genre conventions. Choose evocative images that capture actual thesis over expected visual tropes.

**Deploy**: When designing presence (book covers, social profiles, brand), avoid category defaults that signal generic thinking.

---

## Tacit 8: Title Last, Not First
"Breakneck" came at the very end—a word containing "violence coiled inside" positive connotations.

**Deploy**: Don't force titles early. Let the work reveal its name. The title should compress the entire thesis into a feeling.
