# Caleb Ralston Personal Brand

Build personal brands that convert through systematic trust-building and contrarian positioning.

## Overview

Caleb Ralston's framework starts with who you ARE (credibility bank), connects to what customers NEED (painful problems), and differentiates through what you BELIEVE differently (contrarian take). This creates brands people buy from, not just watch.

**Core Philosophy:** "Optimize for trust, not virality."

## Deployable Capabilities

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
BUILDING PERSONAL BRAND
    │
    ├─→ What's in your Credibility Bank?
    │     └─→ If thin → Build credibility while creating content
    │
    ├─→ Are you Student or Expert?
    │     ├─→ Student → Learn in public, be the guinea pig
    │     └─→ Expert → Teach from achieved results
    │
    ├─→ What's your Contrarian Position?
    │     └─→ Two-Column Extraction → Test → Double down
    │
    ├─→ What painful problems do CUSTOMERS have?
    │     └─→ (Not what followers want to see)
    │
    └─→ What's your Brand Statement?
          └─→ "I believe [audience] should [contrarian] not [common]"
```

## Quick Start

1. **Day 1**: Audit your credibility bank (achievements, results, proof)
2. **Day 2**: Diagnose Student vs Expert track
3. **Day 3**: Two-Column Extraction for contrarian positions
4. **Day 7**: Complete brand statement + test content

## Key Principles

### Customer Signals Over Follower Signals
High-ticket buyers DM privately—they rarely comment publicly. Optimize for customer signals, not engagement metrics.

### Pairing × Consistency = Association
What you consistently pair yourself with becomes what you're associated with. Choose deliberately.

### Contrarian, Not Controversial
Take positions you genuinely believe. Never manufacture controversy for engagement.
