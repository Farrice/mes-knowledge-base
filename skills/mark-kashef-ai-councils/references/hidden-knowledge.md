## Tacit 1: Sycophancy is Architectural
You cannot prompt your way out of AI sycophancy. "Be honest with me" doesn't work. Opposition must be structurally required through conflicting mandates.

**Deploy**: Build systems where agents CAN'T agree even if they wanted to.

---

## Tacit 2: Mandates Create Consistent Behavior
Personality descriptions produce inconsistent agents. Behavioral mandates ("must always X before Y") produce reliable, distinctive outputs.

**Deploy**: Replace personality words with behavioral requirements.

---

## Tacit 3: Shared Memory Enables Learning
Without shared reasoning files, each council session starts fresh. With them, wisdom accumulates across decisions.

**Deploy**: Always capture reasoning, not just conclusions.

---

## Tacit 4: Subagents Preserve Context Quality
Claude Code subagents run in separate contexts. Main conversation stays focused while subagents do heavy reasoning.

**Deploy**: Offload intensive reasoning to subagents to prevent degradation.

---

## Tacit 5: Opposition Reveals Blind Spots
The value isn't in the "right" perspective—it's in the tension between perspectives that surfaces assumptions you didn't know you had.

**Deploy**: Design councils for maximum productive tension.

---

## Tacit 6: Invocation Friction Kills Usage
If summoning a council requires complex setup, you won't use it. Single-phrase activation eliminates friction.

**Deploy**: Make council activation effortless.

---

## Tacit 7: Calibration Through Tracking
Which agent was right? Track predictions over time to calibrate agent reliability and fine-tune mandates.

**Deploy**: Build prediction tracking into council operations.

---

## Tacit 8: Unanimous Agreement is a Red Flag
If all agents agree, either the decision is trivial or your council design has failed.

**Deploy**: Treat consensus as signal to probe deeper.
