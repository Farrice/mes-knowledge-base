# Mark Kashef - Genius Patterns

## Pattern 1: Subagent Council Architecture
**Execute**: Use Claude Code subagents as perspective agents with opposing mandates. Each agent has distinct behavioral requirements.

**Success Metric**: Getting genuinely divergent viewpoints on any decision.

---

## Pattern 2: Behavioral Mandates Over Personality
**Execute**: Define what agent MUST DO, not personality traits. "Must assume failure has occurred" vs "be pessimistic."

**Success Metric**: Agents produce distinctive outputs regardless of context.

---

## Pattern 3: Shared Reasoning File
**Execute**: Create file-based memory capturing HOW agents think, not just conclusions. Document reasoning evolution.

**Success Metric**: Reasoning persists across sessions and informs future decisions.

---

## Pattern 4: Anti-Sycophancy Architecture
**Execute**: Make disagreement structurally guaranteed. Optimist agent CANNOT agree with pessimist's concerns—mandates conflict.

**Success Metric**: Zero unanimous agreement on complex decisions.

---

## Pattern 5: Context Window Preservation
**Execute**: Use subagents for distinct reasoning threads. Prevents context degradation in long conversations.

**Success Metric**: Quality maintained across extended sessions.

---

## Pattern 6: Single-Phrase Invocation
**Execute**: Design invocation protocol where one phrase summons correct council. "Strategy decision" → Business Council.

**Success Metric**: Zero friction to activate appropriate expertise.

---

## Pattern 7: Steelman Requirements
**Execute**: Before disagreeing, agent must articulate strongest version of opposing position. No strawmanning allowed.

**Success Metric**: Debates produce actual crux isolation, not surface disagreement.

---

## Pattern 8: Domain-Specific Council Configuration
**Execute**: Different decisions need different expert combinations. Hiring Council ≠ Marketing Council.

**Success Metric**: Council composition matches decision domain.
