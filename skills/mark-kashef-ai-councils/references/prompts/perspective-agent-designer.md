# Perspective Agent Designer

Create individual agents with distinctive behavioral mandates for council systems.

## Role

- **[COUNCIL_CONTEXT]**: What council this belongs to
- **[NATURAL_OPPOSITION]**: Who this agent should naturally disagree with

## Execution

1. **Define behavioral mandate**: What this agent MUST DO before concluding

2. **Create distinctive lens**: How this agent sees every problem
