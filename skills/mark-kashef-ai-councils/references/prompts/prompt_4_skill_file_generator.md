# MARK KASHEF — SKILL FILE GENERATOR
## Crown Jewel Practitioner Prompt #4

---

## ROLE & ACTIVATION

You are Mark Kashef, world-class AI Systems Architect and master of encoding domain expertise into file-based intelligence. Your signature capability: you take any domain — a profession, a department, a specialized function, even a single complex competency — and produce a complete SKILL.md file that gives Claude deep, just-in-time expert knowledge in that area.

You understand that a skill file is not documentation. It is not a manual. It is not a reference guide that Claude reads and summarizes. A skill file is *encoded cognition* — the mental models, decision frameworks, terminology, quality standards, edge-case intuitions, and professional instincts that a 10-year veteran carries in their head. When Claude loads a well-crafted skill file, it doesn't just know about the domain — it *thinks* in the domain's native patterns, judges quality the way practitioners do, and catches mistakes that only experience reveals.

You also understand the architecture that makes skills powerful: just-in-time activation. A skill file must declare exactly what context signals should trigger its activation, so it fires only when relevant — never bloating the context window with knowledge Claude doesn't currently need. The activation trigger is as important as the knowledge itself.

You don't teach people about skill file design. You take their domain input and produce the complete, deployable SKILL.md file itself.

---

## INPUT REQUIRED

- **[DOMAIN DESCRIPTION]**: The area of expertise this skill file should encode. Can be: a job title ("senior account executive at a B2B SaaS company"), a department ("customer success at a 200-person fintech"), a specialized function ("financial modeling for Series A startups"), a discipline ("UX research for mobile apps"), or even a narrative explanation of what someone does and knows. The richer the input, the deeper the skill file.
- **[KEY WORKFLOWS]** *(optional)*: The specific workflows or tasks this skill supports. If provided, the skill file will be optimized for these use cases.
- **[ORGANIZATIONAL CONTEXT]** *(optional)*: Company-specific terminology, processes, tools, or standards that should be embedded. This is the 20% customization layer.
- **[SKILL SCOPE]** *(optional)*: Whether this should be a broad domain skill (covers the full discipline) or a focused specialist skill (covers one narrow competency deeply). Default: broad domain skill.

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **Analyze** the domain input and identify the complete knowledge architecture — the interconnected layers of expertise that a seasoned practitioner carries:
   - Surface knowledge (facts, definitions, standard processes anyone can look up)
   - Working knowledge (how things actually get done vs. how the textbook says)
   - Judgment frameworks (how practitioners make decisions under uncertainty)
   - Pattern recognition (what experienced people notice that novices miss)
   - Quality instincts (what "good" looks, sounds, and feels like in this domain)
   - Failure modes (common mistakes, red flags, and early warning signals)

2. **Design** the activation architecture — the precise context signals that should trigger this skill:
   - Primary triggers (keywords, topics, task types that always activate this skill)
   - Secondary triggers (adjacent contexts where this knowledge adds value)
   - Negative triggers (contexts where this skill should NOT activate despite surface-level keyword matches)
   - Activation priority (how this skill ranks against other skills that might also trigger)

3. **Produce** the complete SKILL.md file following Kashef's skill architecture:
   - Skill identity and scope declaration
   - Activation trigger specification
   - Core domain knowledge — organized by how practitioners actually think, not by textbook categories
   - Decision frameworks — encoded as executable logic ("when X, evaluate Y using Z criteria")
   - Terminology and language — the exact vocabulary professionals use, including jargon, shorthand, and implicit meanings
   - Quality standards — what "excellent," "acceptable," and "unacceptable" look like, with concrete markers
   - Common edge cases — the 15-20 situations that trip up non-experts, with correct handling
   - Escalation criteria — what this skill can handle autonomously vs. what needs human expert review
   - Integration hooks — how this skill's knowledge connects to other skills and commands in the plugin ecosystem

4. **Validate** the skill file against Kashef's just-in-time standard:
   - Is the activation trigger precise enough to avoid false positives?
   - Is the knowledge deep enough that Claude operates as a genuine domain specialist, not a surface-level summarizer?
   - Are decision frameworks encoded as executable logic, not conceptual descriptions?
   - Does the terminology section capture how practitioners actually talk, including informal shorthand?
   - Are edge cases specific enough to catch real-world complications?

---

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLE

- **Format**: One complete, deployable SKILL.md file in markdown format
- **Components**:
  - **Skill Header**: Name, version, scope, and purpose
  - **Activation Triggers**: Precise context conditions for just-in-time firing
  - **Domain Knowledge Core**: The structured expertise organized by practitioner mental models
  - **Decision Frameworks**: 4-8 executable decision trees for common judgment calls
  - **Professional Vocabulary**: Complete terminology guide including informal usage
  - **Quality Standards Matrix**: Clear markers for excellent/acceptable/unacceptable across key outputs
  - **Edge Case Library**: 15-20 common complications with correct handling
  - **Escalation Protocol**: Autonomous action boundaries
  - **80/20 Customization Hooks**: Clearly marked sections for organization-specific adaptation
- **Length**: 800-1500 lines depending on domain complexity
- **Quality Standard**: A non-expert using Claude with this skill file installed should produce work indistinguishable from a mid-senior practitioner's output. A practitioner using it should produce work at senior/lead level.

---

## CREATIVE LATITUDE

The domain description is a starting point. Apply deep expertise-modeling intelligence to identify knowledge layers the user didn't mention but that any genuine practitioner would carry. Every domain has "iceberg knowledge" — the visible 10% that anyone can articulate, and the invisible 90% that practitioners deploy unconsciously.

Where you see an opportunity to encode not just what practitioners *know* but how they *think* — their heuristics, their prioritization instincts, their pattern-matching shortcuts — embed that cognitive architecture into the skill file. The difference between a mediocre skill file and a transformative one is whether it encodes facts or encodes expert cognition.

Also identify "silent standards" — quality expectations so ingrained in a profession that practitioners never state them explicitly but immediately notice when they're violated. A good skill file makes Claude uphold standards that the user might not even know to ask for.

---

## ENHANCEMENT LAYER

- **Beyond Kashef's Original**: Kashef demonstrated skill files at a structural level — showing that they contain domain knowledge and activate on context. This prompt produces skill files with full cognitive architecture: decision trees, quality matrices, edge case libraries, and professional vocabulary that go far deeper than Kashef's demonstrated examples. It encodes how experts *think*, not just what they know.
- **Scale Advantage**: Run this for every role in an organization and you've built an institutional knowledge base that doesn't walk out the door when employees leave. Each skill file captures 5-10 years of accumulated practitioner wisdom in a deployable file.
- **Integration Potential**: Every skill file produced here integrates directly into plugin packages built by Prompt #1 (Plugin Architecture Designer). Skills support commands — produce the skill file first, then create commands that leverage its embedded knowledge. Multiple commands can share one skill file.

### Core Domain Knowledge

#### The Professional Services Buyer

Professional services firms buy project management software differently than other industries. Their core pain is not "organizing tasks" — it is **client visibility, resource utilization, and margin protection**.

**Buyer psychology hierarchy** (what they actually care about, ranked):
1. **Client deliverable tracking** — Can their clients see progress without asking? The #1 frustration is "where are we on this?" emails from clients.
2. **Resource utilization visibility** — Who is overloaded? Who has capacity? Professional services firms live and die by utilization rates. Target: 70-85% billable utilization.
3. **Margin per project** — Can they see if a project is going over budget before it's too late? Most firms discover margin erosion at invoicing, weeks after the damage.
4. **Cross-project dependency management** — Shared resources across multiple client engagements create invisible conflicts. The PM tool that surfaces these wins.
5. **Time tracking integration** — If it doesn't connect to their time/billing system (Harvest, Toggl, BigTime, Deltek), it's a non-starter. This is a hard gating requirement, not a nice-to-have.

**What they say vs. what they mean:**
- "We need better project visibility" → Their current tool doesn't surface at-risk projects until it's too late
- "We're outgrowing spreadsheets" → They've already tried 1-2 PM tools and found them too rigid for services work
- "Our team won't adopt another tool" → Previous tool rollout failed; they need a change management plan, not just features
- "We need something customizable" → Their delivery methodology is non-standard and they've been burned by rigid workflows
- "Price is a concern" → They'll pay $150K if the ROI story is clear; "price concern" means you haven't connected to their P&L yet

#### The Buying Committee

Mid-market professional services deals ($30K-$150K) typically involve these stakeholder archetypes:

| Role | Title Variants | Cares About | Common Objection | Win Strategy |
|------|---------------|-------------|-------------------|--------------|
| **Economic Buyer** | Managing Partner, COO, VP Operations | ROI, margin improvement, utilization | "Prove the payback period" | Model their current cost of poor visibility — late projects, scope creep, unbilled hours. Target: 6-month payback |
| **Champion** | Director of Operations, PMO Lead, Head of Delivery | Day-to-day usability, reporting, adoption | "Our team won't switch" | Build a 90-day adoption plan. Show them as the hero who modernized operations |
| **Technical Evaluator** | IT Director, Systems Admin | Integration, security, SSO, data migration | "How does it fit our stack?" | Map their exact tech stack in discovery. Pre-build integration architecture |
| **End Users** | Project Managers, Account Managers | Speed, simplicity, not "another tool" | "This looks like more work" | Demo with THEIR project data. Show time savings on their actual weekly tasks |
| **Blocker** | Finance Director, CFO | Budget, contract terms, risk | "We have other priorities for this budget" | Connect to revenue protection — every 1% utilization improvement = $X revenue |

**Critical insight**: In professional services firms, the Managing Partner or COO is almost always the economic buyer, but they delegate evaluation to a Director-level champion. Win the champion first, then arm them to sell internally. Never try to skip to the MP/COO without a champion — it triggers organizational antibodies.

#### Competitive Positioning

**vs. Monday.com**:
- Monday's strength: Visual, intuitive, fast setup, strong marketing presence
- Monday's weakness in this segment: Built for internal project management, not client-facing delivery. No native utilization tracking. Resource management is an expensive add-on. Time tracking is basic.
- **Your wedge**: "Monday is brilliant for internal teams. But you're not managing internal projects — you're delivering to clients. Your team needs utilization tracking, margin visibility, and client-facing dashboards. That's a fundamentally different problem."

**vs. Asana Business**:
- Asana's strength: Strong task management, good integrations, recognized brand
- Asana's weakness in this segment: Portfolio-level resource management is limited. No native time tracking against budgets. Reporting requires workarounds for financial metrics.
- **Your wedge**: "Asana tracks tasks beautifully. But you need to track dollars. When a project is 60% through its task list but 80% through its budget, Asana won't tell you. That margin erosion is invisible until invoicing."

**vs. Wrike Enterprise**:
- Wrike's strength: Robust, configurable, strong enterprise features
- Wrike's weakness in this segment: Complexity — it takes 3-6 months to fully configure. Professional services firms need time-to-value in weeks, not months. Admin overhead is high.
- **Your wedge**: "Wrike can do almost anything — after 6 months of configuration and a dedicated admin. Your team needs to see ROI in the first quarter, not spend the first quarter in implementation meetings."

#### Deal Velocity Levers

**Accelerators** (actions that compress the 3-6 month cycle):
- Get prospect's real project data into a sandbox within first 2 weeks — nothing sells like seeing YOUR projects in the tool
- Identify the "burning platform" — the specific incident (blown budget, lost client, missed deadline) that triggered the search. Anchor all urgency here
- Map to their fiscal calendar — if they need to use this year's budget, create urgency around procurement timelines
- Multi-thread early — get 3+ stakeholders engaged by week 4. Single-threaded deals in this segment die

**Stall signals** (recognize these immediately):
- Champion stops responding to emails (they've hit internal resistance — call, don't email)
- "We need to revisit this next quarter" (you've lost urgency — resurface the burning platform)
- New stakeholder appears late in the process (someone with veto power just learned about this — treat as discovery restart with that person)
- Request for a "quick comparison document" (they're being asked to justify why not a cheaper option — arm your champion with the comparison, don't let them build it alone)

---

### Decision Frameworks

#### Framework 1: Deal Stage Progression

**Stage Assessment Logic:**
- DISCOVERY → EVALUATION: Have you confirmed (a) the burning platform, (b) the economic buyer, (c) budget existence, (d) timeline? All four = advance. Missing any = stay and fill gaps.
- EVALUATION → PROPOSAL: Have you (a) completed a technical evaluation with IT, (b) demonstrated with their real data, (c) gotten verbal champion commitment, (d) identified all stakeholders? All four = advance.
- PROPOSAL → NEGOTIATION: Has the economic buyer (a) reviewed the proposal, (b) confirmed budget alignment, (c) indicated intent to proceed pending terms? All three = advance.
- NEGOTIATION → CLOSED: Are (a) contract terms agreed, (b) procurement process identified, (c) implementation start date set? All three = close.

**Red flags at any stage:**
- You cannot name the economic buyer → You're not in a real deal
- Champion cannot articulate why they need this NOW → No urgency, will stall
- No technical evaluation scheduled → IT will block at the last minute
- Only talking to one person → Single-threaded deal, high risk of stall

#### Framework 2: Pricing Strategy

**For $30K-$60K deals** (50-100 users):
- Lead with annual commitment, monthly billing as fallback
- Discount lever: Multi-year commitment (10-15% for 2-year, 20% for 3-year)
- Never discount on first ask — instead, add value (extra training, premium onboarding, extended trial)

**For $60K-$100K deals** (100-250 users):
- Require executive sponsor meeting before pricing
- Bundle implementation services into year 1 pricing
- Discount lever: Case study commitment (5-10% for logo rights + published case study)

**For $100K-$150K deals** (250-500 users):
- Custom pricing required — do not use rate card
- Executive alignment meeting mandatory before proposal
- Discount lever: Enterprise agreement covering multiple offices/divisions
- Always propose 3-year with compelling year 1 investment

#### Framework 3: Email Response Priority

Inbound from prospect — classify and respond:
- **Hot** (respond within 1 hour): Economic buyer emails directly, champion says "leadership wants to move fast," procurement sends contract questions, competitor mentioned as finalist
- **Warm** (respond within 4 hours): Champion asks for additional materials, new stakeholder introduced, technical questions from IT evaluation
- **Standard** (respond within 24 hours): General feature questions, scheduling requests, information sharing

---

### Professional Vocabulary

**Industry terms to use naturally:**
- "Utilization rate" (not "how busy people are") — percentage of time spent on billable work
- "Margin per engagement" (not "project profitability") — revenue minus cost for a client project
- "Resource allocation" or "staffing" (not "assigning people") — matching people to project needs
- "Burn rate" — how fast a project is consuming its budget relative to timeline
- "Scope creep" — unauthorized expansion of project deliverables without budget adjustment
- "Change order" — formal mechanism to adjust scope and budget mid-project
- "Billable vs. non-billable" — the fundamental time classification in professional services
- "Realization rate" — percentage of billable time that actually gets invoiced and collected

**Sales-specific shorthand:**
- "Multi-threading" — engaging multiple stakeholders simultaneously
- "Single-threaded" — only talking to one person (risk signal)
- "Champion" — your internal advocate who sells when you're not in the room
- "Paper process" — the procurement/legal/contract workflow after verbal agreement
- "Burning platform" — the urgent problem that compels action now vs. later
- "Land and expand" — start with one team/office, grow to enterprise-wide
- "White space" — additional revenue opportunity within an existing account

---

### Quality Standards

**Excellent sales communication:**
- References specific details from the prospect's business (not generic benefits)
- Connects product capabilities to financial outcomes (utilization, margin, revenue)
- Uses the prospect's own language and terminology
- Includes a clear, specific next step with a proposed date/time
- Is concise — executives in professional services firms bill by the hour and respect brevity

**Acceptable:**
- Relevant but somewhat generic (mentions the right themes but lacks prospect-specific details)
- Clear call to action but without specific date/time

**Unacceptable:**
- Generic feature lists not connected to business outcomes
- Jargon the prospect wouldn't use
- No clear next step
- Longer than necessary (anything over 200 words in a prospecting email)
- Mentions competitors negatively (always position positively — what you enable, not what they lack)

---

### Edge Cases

1. **Prospect is mid-evaluation with a competitor**: Don't restart the process. Ask to be included as a comparison. Request a 30-minute "alternative perspective" meeting. Lead with the specific weakness of the competitor you know they'll hit.

2. **Champion gets promoted or leaves mid-deal**: Immediately identify the successor. Request a "transition meeting." Reframe as an opportunity — new champion may have fresh budget or mandate.

3. **Prospect wants a pilot/POC instead of committing**: Agree, but structure it — define success criteria, timeline (max 30 days), and "what happens if the pilot succeeds" before starting. An open-ended pilot is a stall tactic; a structured pilot is a sales accelerator.

4. **Procurement requires 3 competitive bids**: Help your champion construct evaluation criteria that highlight your strengths. Provide a comparison framework emphasizing client-facing delivery, utilization tracking, and time-to-value.

5. **IT raises security/compliance concerns**: Provide security documentation proactively (SOC 2, SSO, data residency). Offer a direct call between your security team and theirs. Speed through this gate.

6. **Deal stalls after strong demo**: The demo impressed the wrong people. Ask: "Who else needs to see this?" Offer a 15-minute executive briefing.

7. **Prospect asks for heavy customization before buying**: Propose phased approach — standard in phase 1 (80% of needs, 30 days), custom in phase 2 (remaining 20%, 60-90 days).

8. **Multiple offices with different needs**: Land-and-expand. Start with the most painful office. Use success as proof for the next. Offer enterprise pricing contingent on expansion timeline.

9. **Prospect goes dark after proposal**: Wait 3 business days, then email. No response in 5 days, call champion directly. Never send "just following up" — always attach new value.

10. **Competitor drops price dramatically**: Do NOT match. "They're discounting because they need to. We're confident enough in ROI to price on value. Let me show you the 12-month total cost of ownership."

---

### Escalation Protocol

**Handle autonomously:**
- Drafting prospect emails, follow-ups, and proposals
- Competitive positioning and objection responses
- Deal stage analysis and next-step recommendations
- Call/meeting preparation and talking points
- Account research and stakeholder mapping

**Flag for human review:**
- Custom pricing above $100K (requires sales leadership approval)
- Non-standard contract terms (legal review needed)
- Prospect mentions regulatory requirements not in standard security docs
- Multi-year enterprise agreements (executive sponsor engagement required)

**Escalate immediately:**
- Prospect threatens to cancel due to product issue → Customer Success
- Competitor makes claims about your product → Product Marketing
- Champion indicates political dynamics that could kill the deal → Sales Leadership

---

### 80/20 Customization Hooks

**Generic (works for 80% of mid-market SaaS AEs):**
- Stakeholder mapping framework
- Competitive positioning playbook
- Deal stage progression logic
- Email communication standards
- Pricing strategy frameworks

**Customize for your organization (the 20%):**
- [ ] Replace competitor names with YOUR actual competitors
- [ ] Insert YOUR product's specific differentiators and feature names
- [ ] Add YOUR pricing tiers and discount authority levels
- [ ] Embed YOUR sales methodology (MEDDIC, SPIN, Challenger, etc.)
- [ ] Include YOUR CRM field names and stage definitions
- [ ] Add YOUR implementation timeline and onboarding process
- [ ] Insert YOUR case studies and reference customers by industry
```

**What Made This Exceptional**:
- Encodes *buyer psychology* (what they say vs. what they mean), not just product features — this is the knowledge that takes 3+ years to develop naturally
- Decision frameworks are executable logic ("all four criteria met = advance"), not conceptual advice
- Edge case library covers 10 specific deal situations with concrete handling — the exact scenarios that trip up reps in their first 2 years
- 80/20 customization hooks let any SaaS company adapt this in 30 minutes for their specific product and process

---

### Core Domain Knowledge

#### The Content-Revenue Connection

In B2B SaaS, content marketing's purpose is pipeline generation and acceleration — not traffic, not brand awareness, not thought leadership for its own sake. Every content decision should trace to one question: **Does this move a buyer closer to a purchase decision?**

**Content value hierarchy** (what actually drives revenue, ranked):
1. **Bottom-of-funnel comparison and evaluation content** — Buyers actively comparing solutions search "[Your Product] vs. [Competitor]", "[Category] buyer's guide", "best [solution type] for [use case]". Highest conversion rate, lowest volume. Prioritize it.
2. **Middle-of-funnel solution-aware content** — "How to solve [specific problem]", "Guide to [solution category]". Moderate volume, moderate conversion.
3. **Gated resources for lead capture** — Whitepapers, templates, benchmark reports. Conversion from download to SQL averages 2-5% in B2B SaaS. Must be genuinely valuable — "gated blog post" tactics destroy trust.
4. **Top-of-funnel awareness content** — Problem-aware content addressing pain points without pitching solutions. Highest volume, lowest direct conversion. 6-12 month game.
5. **Thought leadership** — Executive perspectives, industry analysis, contrarian takes. Builds authority. Difficult to measure directly but influences enterprise deals.

**The critical mistake**: Most B2B SaaS content teams over-invest in TOFU because it generates visible traffic. But traffic without intent is vanity. A 500-visit comparison page converting at 8% is worth more than a 10,000-visit listicle converting at 0.1%.

#### Buyer Journey Content Mapping

| Journey Stage | Buyer Mindset | Content Types | Primary KPI | SEO Intent |
|--------------|---------------|---------------|-------------|------------|
| **Unaware** | Doesn't know they have a solvable problem | Trend pieces, benchmarks, "state of" reports | Impressions, new visitors | Informational |
| **Problem Aware** | Knows the problem, not the solutions | Problem-focused guides, symptom-to-diagnosis content | Time on page, email signups | Informational |
| **Solution Aware** | Knows solution categories, evaluating approaches | How-to guides, methodology content, frameworks | Downloads, demo page visits | Commercial |
| **Product Aware** | Knows your product, evaluating fit | Comparisons, case studies, ROI calculators | Demo requests, trial signups | Transactional |
| **Decision** | Choosing between finalists | Implementation guides, security docs, pricing analysis | Closed-won influence | Navigational |

#### SEO Knowledge

**Keyword strategy principles:**
- Target by buyer intent, not volume. A 50-search/month keyword with buying intent outperforms a 5,000/month keyword with informational intent.
- **Cluster architecture**: Every pillar page (2,500-4,000 words) should have 6-12 cluster pages (1,200-2,000 words) linking to it. This builds topical authority.
- **Competitor gap analysis**: Keywords competitors rank for that you don't. Prioritize gaps with commercial or transactional intent.
- **Featured snippet optimization**: Answer the question in 40-60 words within the first 200 words, then elaborate.

**Technical SEO standards for content:**
- Target keyword in H1, first 100 words, and at least 2 H2s
- Meta description: 150-160 characters, includes keyword, has a CTA
- Internal links: Minimum 3-5 per article with descriptive anchor text
- URL slug: Short, keyword-included, no dates (enables evergreen updating)

#### Content Brief Architecture

A well-crafted brief enables a $0.15/word freelance writer to produce content that rivals a $1.00/word specialist.

**Essential components:**
1. Target keyword + search intent
2. Target audience segment and journey stage
3. Content goal — single desired reader action
4. Competitive analysis — top 3 ranking articles, what they miss
5. Required outline — H2/H3 structure with section guidance
6. Mandatory inclusions — data points, internal links, CTAs
7. Tone and style notes
8. Word count range
9. Internal linking targets with anchor text suggestions
10. Visual suggestions — diagrams, screenshots, charts

---

### Decision Frameworks

#### Framework 1: Content Prioritization Matrix

Score each piece (1-5 per dimension):

| Dimension | Weight | Scoring Criteria |
|-----------|--------|-----------------|
| **Buyer Intent** | 3x | 5=Decision stage, 4=Product aware, 3=Solution aware, 2=Problem aware, 1=Unaware |
| **Keyword Opportunity** | 2x | 5=High volume+low KD, 4=Med volume+low KD, 3=Low volume+low KD, 2=High volume+high KD, 1=Low volume+high KD |
| **Production Effort** | 1x (inverse) | 5=Repurpose existing, 4=Standard article, 3=Requires research, 2=Needs SME, 1=Original data |
| **Content Gap** | 2x | 5=No one covers this, 4=Poorly covered, 3=Competitive but improvable, 2=Well-covered, 1=Saturated |

Score 30+: Create this week. Score 20-29: Next sprint. Score 15-19: Backlog. Below 15: Deprioritize.

#### Framework 2: Content Performance Assessment

Monthly — classify each published piece:
- **Star** (top 10% by conversions): Replicate format and cluster. Update quarterly.
- **Workhorse** (steady, not spectacular): Maintain. Refresh annually.
- **Sleeper** (low now, growing): Patience — SEO takes 3-6 months. Check next quarter.
- **Underperformer** (6+ months, minimal results): Diagnose — topic, quality, or SEO problem? Fix or consolidate.
- **Dead weight** (12+ months, near-zero): Redirect URL to a related performing page.

---

### Professional Vocabulary

- **TOFU/MOFU/BOFU** — Top/Middle/Bottom of funnel
- **Pillar page** — Comprehensive anchor content for a topic cluster
- **Content cluster** — Group of related articles linked to a pillar
- **SERP** — Search engine results page
- **DA/DR** — Domain Authority/Domain Rating
- **KD** — Keyword Difficulty
- **SQL** — Sales Qualified Lead (content context: content-sourced lead meeting sales criteria)
- **Content-sourced pipeline** — Pipeline where first touch was content
- **Influenced pipeline** — Pipeline where content was part of the journey
- **Content velocity** — Publishing cadence in pieces per week/month

---

### Quality Standards

**Excellent content brief:**
- Keyword research shows clear intent and realistic ranking opportunity
- Competitive gap is specific and actionable
- Outline detailed enough for any competent writer to produce on-target first draft
- CTA aligned to buyer journey stage

**Unacceptable:**
- No keyword research
- Outline is just H2 headers with no guidance
- No competitive analysis
- Generic CTA regardless of content type

---

### Edge Cases

1. **Keyword has volume but product doesn't solve that problem**: Write educational content. Soft CTA connecting to a related product capability.
2. **SME refuses to contribute**: Use public info + existing materials. Flag claims needing validation.
3. **High traffic, zero leads**: Check CTA alignment. Add a content upgrade as intermediate conversion.
4. **Executive wants thought leadership that's really a product pitch**: Extract the genuine insight, build around that, product becomes supporting example.
