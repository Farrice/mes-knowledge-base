# Mark Kashef - Implementation Pathway

## 24-Hour Quickstart

**Hour 0-2**: Study council architecture concepts
- Understand subagent capability in Claude Code
- Review behavioral mandate vs personality distinction

**Hour 2-6**: Create first claude.md council configuration
- Define 3 perspective agents with mandates
- Create shared_reasoning.md template

**Hour 6-12**: Run first council session
- Present real pending decision
- Document each agent's reasoning
- Identify cruxes and tensions

**Hour 12-24**: Evaluate and calibrate
- Did agents produce genuinely different perspectives?
- Adjust mandates for more productive tension
