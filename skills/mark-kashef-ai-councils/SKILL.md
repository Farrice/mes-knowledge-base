# Mark Kashef AI Councils

> The problem with asking one AI for feedback is sycophancy. The solution is building councils where disagreement is architecturally guaranteed through opposing agent mandates.

## Overview

Mark Kashef discovered that Claude Code's subagent capability—primarily used for technical tasks—can be weaponized as a **multi-perspective decision council** that neutralizes AI sycophancy while preserving context window integrity. His system uses behavioral mandates, shared reasoning files, and structured debate to produce genuinely stress-tested decisions.

**Core Insight**: Sycophancy is an *architectural* problem, not prompt-based. You cannot ask Claude to "be honest"—you must build systems where disagreement is structurally guaranteed.

## Core Architecture

| Component | Purpose |
|-----------|---------|
| **claude.md** | Council configuration and invocation protocols |
| **Perspective Agents** | Individual agents with opposing behavioral mandates |
| **Shared Reasoning** | File-based memory capturing HOW agents think |
| **Debate Protocol** | Structured disagreement with steelman requirements |

## Deployable Capabilities

| Prompt | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| [Council Architect](references/prompts/council-architect.md) | Designing complete council infrastructure |
| [Perspective Agent Designer](references/prompts/perspective-agent-designer.md) | Creating agents with distinctive mandates |
| [Debate Orchestrator](references/prompts/debate-orchestrator.md) | Running structured adversarial discussions |
| [Council Auditor](references/prompts/council-auditor.md) | Evaluating council performance |

## Key Principles

1. **Behavioral Mandates > Personality**: Pre-Mortem Analyst must "assume failure," not "be pessimistic"
2. **Shared Reasoning**: Document HOW agents think, not just conclusions
3. **Context Preservation**: Subagents prevent context window degradation
4. **Domain-Specific Councils**: Marketing Council differs from Hiring Council
5. **Anti-Sycophancy Architecture**: Opposition is structural, not requested

## Council Templates

- **Business Strategy Council**: CFO, Growth, Risk, Customer Advocate
- **Content Strategy Council**: Audience, Monetization, Quality, Distribution
- **Personal Decision Council**: Values, Practical, Devil's Advocate, Future Self
- **Creative Council**: Innovation, Execution, Audience, Quality

## Quick Start

1. Create claude.md with council configuration
2. Define 3-4 perspective agents with behavioral mandates
3. Create shared_reasoning.md for memory
4. Run first council session on real decision
5. Review and calibrate agent mandates
