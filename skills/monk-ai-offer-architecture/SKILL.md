## Core Principle

**The Offer Pyramid**: Every conversation needs escape hatches. If someone can't say yes to $15K implementation, can they say yes to $2K audit? If not audit, can they say yes to $500 sprint? Every price point builds trust for the next level.

**60-70% vs 5-20%**: Repeat client conversion is 60-70%. New prospect conversion is 5-20%. Design your business around the math.
