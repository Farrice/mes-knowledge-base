## EXAMPLE OUTPUT: AI Implementation Proposal

**PROPOSAL: Custom AI Implementation for [Company Name]**

---

**EXECUTIVE SUMMARY**

[Company] is spending approximately 42 hours weekly on manual data processing across order management, customer service, and inventory systems. We propose a 6-week Custom AI Implementation to automate these workflows, recover 35+ hours weekly, and create a foundation for ongoing optimization. Investment: $12,000 with milestone-based payments.

---

**CURRENT SITUATION**

Based on our Opportunity Audit, we identified:
- 147 manual handoffs between systems daily
- 42 hours weekly spent on automatable tasks
- ~$98,000 annual labor cost for work that doesn't require human judgment
- Customer service tickets at 3x industry average due to manual delays

As Sarah noted in our discovery call: "My operations manager is drowning in data entry when she should be solving problems."

---

**PROPOSED SOLUTION**

**What We'll Build**:
1. Order-to-fulfillment automation (eliminating 18 manual handoffs)
2. Customer inquiry auto-response system (handling 40% of tickets)
3. Inventory sync between Shopify, warehouse, and accounting
4. Exception alerting (humans only touch what needs human touch)

**How We'll Work**:
- Week 1-2: Architecture + first integration live
- Week 3-4: Core automations built and tested
- Week 5-6: Full deployment, team training, optimization

**What You'll Get**:
- 35+ hours weekly recovered
- Automated workflows documented for your team
- Training for operations staff
- 30-day post-launch support

**TIMELINE & MILESTONES**

| Week | Deliverable | Payment Trigger |
|------|-------------|-----------------|
| 0 | Kickoff | 50% ($6,000) |
| 3 | First automation live | 25% ($3,000) |
| 6 | Full deployment complete | 25% ($3,000) |

---

**INVESTMENT**

**Total**: $12,000

**Value Context**:
- 35 hours/week recovered × $45/hour = $81,900 annual savings
- Payback period: Under 60 days
- Year 1 ROI: 6.8x

**Payment Structure**:
- 50% at kickoff ($6,000)
- 25% at Week 3 milestone ($3,000)
- 25% at completion ($3,000)

**Audit Credit**: Your $1,500 audit investment applies as credit, making effective investment $10,500.

---

**RISK MITIGATION**

- **Milestone Gates**: You can stop at Week 3 if not satisfied, keeping completed work
- **Performance Guarantee**: If automations don't save 20+ hours weekly, we continue working at no charge
- **Documentation**: Everything built is documented—you're never dependent on us to maintain it

---
