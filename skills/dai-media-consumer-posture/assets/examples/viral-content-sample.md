- Everyone doing "5 tips for remote productivity"
- Everyone claiming to understand "the future of work"

## Shareable Truth Register (Sample)

**The Meeting Trap:**
1. "I schedule meetings because I don't trust my team to handle things without me watching—and I hate that about myself"
2. "Half my 1:1s exist because I don't know how else to check in without seeming like a micromanager"

**The Connection Crisis:**
6. "I'm managing people I barely know as humans and it's too late to ask about their lives"
7. "I used to have friends at work. Now I have Slack threads"

**The Hypocrisy Zone:**
21. "I tell my team to protect their calendar while mine is 80% meetings"
22. "I preach async communication and then ping people for immediate responses"

## Recognition Triggers (Sample)

**The Confession Format:**
- "I just scheduled a meeting to prepare for a meeting that exists to plan a meeting."
- "Realized today I know more about my direct reports' Zoom backgrounds than their actual lives."

**The Quiet Truth Format:**
- "Nobody talks about how lonely it is to manage a team you never see."
- "We replaced hallway conversations with scheduled hallway conversations and called it culture."

## 30-Day Calendar (Week 1)

**Day 1**: "I just scheduled a meeting to prepare for a meeting that exists to plan a meeting. I am the problem."

**Day 2**: "Asked my team 'how's everyone doing?' Got seven thumbs-up emojis. Logged it as 'team connection done.'"

**Day 3**: "The number of meetings I attend is inversely proportional to the amount of work I get done."

**Day 4**: Carousel: "6 types of meetings that should be emails (but we're too polite to say)"

**Day 5**: "If you've ever declined a meeting to attend a different meeting about the same topic, you're not alone"
