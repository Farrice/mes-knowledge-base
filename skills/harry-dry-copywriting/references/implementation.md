# Harry Dry Implementation Pathway

## 24-Hour Quickstart

**Hour 0-2:** Study five 3/3 ads (New Balance, iPod, Economist, Volkswagen, Hinge). Identify what makes each pass all three tests.

**Hour 2-6:** Apply Three Rules Test to your current homepage/landing page. Score each headline and key message. List what fails and why.

**Hour 6-12:** Rewrite three failing pieces using Zoom-In Technique and Falsifiability Filter. Create before/after comparison.

**Hour 12-24:** Move rewrites into visual context (Figma/Canva). Refine until One Mississippi Test passes. Deploy one improved piece.

## 7-Day Sprint

**Days 1-2:** Master evaluation (Three Rules Test on 30 pieces—yours and others)

**Days 3-4:** Master translation (Zoom-In and Falsifiability on all key messages)

**Days 5-6:** Master production (Full ad/newsletter using visual-verbal synthesis)

**Day 7:** Master quality (Garden Walk + refinement until nothing can be removed)
