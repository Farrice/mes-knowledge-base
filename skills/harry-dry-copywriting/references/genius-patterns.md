# Harry Dry Genius Patterns

## Pattern 1: The Three Rules Test
Every sentence passes through a three-gate filter: visualization, falsifiability, uniqueness.

**Executable:** (1) Can I literally picture this? (2) Could this be proved true or false? (3) Could a competitor sign this? Three yeses = deploy. Any no = rewrite.

---

## Pattern 2: The Zoom-In Technique
When encountering abstract language, repeatedly ask "what do I actually mean?" until arriving at concrete, tangible objects.

**Executable:** Draw vertical line. Write abstract at top. Keep rewriting downward until you reach something you can drop on your foot. "Regain fitness" → "Couch to 5K"

---

## Pattern 3: The Falsifiability Filter
Replace every adjective with a pointed fact.

**Executable:** Instead of "intelligent" → "reads on the tube." Instead of "good-looking" → "looks like Ryan Gosling, 6'2"."

---

## Pattern 4: "Don't Talk, Only Point"
Eliminate persuasion through assertion. Replace with persuasion through evidence.

**Executable:** For every benefit claim, identify something external you can point to: a chart, a quote, a number. If you can't point to it, don't say it.

---

## Pattern 5: The Uniqueness Test
Filter copy through "could a competitor sign this?"

**Executable:** Mentally place competitor logos beneath your copy. If it works for them, it's generic. Dig for what only YOU can say.

---

## Pattern 6: The One Mississippi Test
Copy must communicate in under 2 seconds.

**Executable:** Show copy to someone for 2 seconds, hide it. Ask: "What was that about?" If they can't tell you, the copy fails.

---

## Pattern 7: Juxtaposition Architecture
Pair opposites to create memorability and tension.

**Executable:** Identify two contrasting elements. Place in direct proximity. Supermodels/dads. London/Ohio. Forever/2 months.

---

## Pattern 8: Visual-Verbal Synthesis
Never separate copywriting from design.

**Executable:** Write in the exact environment where it will be consumed. Newsletter copy in ConvertKit. Ads in Figma. Never isolated Word docs.

---

## Pattern 9: The Conflict Injection Method
Structure every piece around implicit "but"—conflict creates narrative momentum.

**Executable:** Before writing, identify conflict: Before/After, Problem/Solution, Common Approach/Our Approach.

---

## Pattern 10: Parallel Structure Obsession
Create rhythm through deliberate parallelism.

**Executable:** Enforce identical grammatical structure in lists. "Raise twice the cash, hire twice the staff, spend twice as much."

---

## Pattern 11: Kaplan's Law Ruthlessness
Every word is either working or against. No neutral words.

**Executable:** Review each word: "Is this word WORKING?" If not actively contributing, subtract it. Maximum density.

---

## Pattern 12: The Two-Line Maximum
Constrain paragraphs to two lines maximum.

**Executable:** Any paragraph exceeding two lines gets split or trimmed. Three lines = not clear enough. Simplify.

---

## Pattern 13: The 20-Rewrite Standard
Trust the process of 20+ iterations.

**Executable:** Set minimum rewrite number (10-25). Don't evaluate until minimum reached. Early versions are "dirty water."

---

## Pattern 14: Time-Place-Action Openings
Open with immediate specificity—exact time, physical location, sensory details.

**Executable:** Start with literal current moment: time on clock, what you see, physical sensation. Ground reader in YOUR reality.

---

## Pattern 15: The Enemy Identification
Position products by defining what they're against.

**Executable:** Identify your enemy: Type A (different approach), Type B (different belief), Type C (direct competitor). Build around contrast.

---

## Pattern 16: The Metonymy Move
Substitute technical terms with visual/emotional ones.

**Executable:** Find technical term. Ask: what's more visual, tangible, surprising? "1000 songs in your media player" → "1000 songs in your pocket."

---

## Pattern 17: The Single-Element Ad Test
Great ads succeed with minimal elements—ideally one.

**Executable:** After creating ad, try removing each element. Can it work with just headline? Just image? Fewer elements = stronger elements.

---

## Pattern 18: The Feedback Versioning System
Create multiple versions before seeking feedback.

**Executable:** Generate 3-5 versions. Present all simultaneously. Ask "which is best?" and "which elements would you combine?"

---

## Pattern 19: The Facts-First Philosophy
Start with verifiable facts, build narrative around them.

**Executable:** Before writing, gather 3-5 specific facts. These become anchors. All narrative emerges from these pegs.

---

## Pattern 20: The Garden Walk Test
Step away, return with fresh eyes.

**Executable:** After believing done, physically leave for 15-30 minutes. Return and ask: "Can I remove anything?" If no, ready. If yes, continue.
