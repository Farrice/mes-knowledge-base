# Harry Dry Hidden Knowledge

## The Dirty Tap Theory
Quality doesn't come from writing well initially—it comes from writing badly long enough that the "dirty water" clears. This removes perfectionism paralysis. First drafts are intentionally loose.

## The Belief Prerequisite
Only writes well about things he genuinely believes. Marketing Examples succeeded because he actually believed marketers should learn from examples. Without authentic conviction, words ring hollow regardless of technique.

## The Design-First Reality
Though teaching "copywriting," actually practices "copy-design"—words never exist without visual context. This is why his work has coherence others can't replicate through words alone.

## The Precision Paradox
"Simple" style is actually extremely precise—every word placement, every rhythm, every line break is deliberate. The simplicity is the result of complexity, not the absence of it.

## The Conflict Addiction
Can't write without tension. Even in casual newsletters, manufactures conflict (mom won't let me wear shorts) because narrative requires opposition. Does this automatically.

## The Experience Debt
Deeply believes AI and copywriting formulas fail because they lack lived experience. "You can't write about New York if you've never been" extends to all subjects—authentic copy requires authentic experience.

## The Compound Effect
Three rules applied separately are good. Three rules applied simultaneously create exponential impact. The compound quality ceiling is what most never approach.

## The Reference Collection Habit
Constantly collects 3/3 ads—copy that passes all three rules. This personal reference library informs intuition and raises standards over time.
