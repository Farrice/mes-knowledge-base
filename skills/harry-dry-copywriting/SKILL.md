# Harry Dry Copywriting

Systematized evaluation and creation of exceptional copy through falsifiable tests and relentless rewriting discipline.

## Overview

Harry Dry's methodology decodes the unconscious patterns behind memorable copy into executable diagnostic questions. Unlike copywriters who rely on intuition or templates, these frameworks reveal exactly why copy works or fails—and how to fix it.

**Core Philosophy:** Every sentence must pass three gates: Can I visualize it? Can I falsify it? Could a competitor sign this?

## Deployable Capabilities

| Capability | Prompt | Use Case |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Three Rules Test | three-rules-test.md | Evaluating any copy before deployment |
| Zoom-In Technique | zoom-in.md | Converting abstract to concrete |
| One Mississippi Test | one-mississippi.md | Checking 2-second comprehension |
| Falsifiability Filter | falsifiability.md | Replacing adjectives with facts |
| Uniqueness Validator | uniqueness.md | Ensuring copy is yours alone |
| Conflict Injector | conflict-injection.md | Adding tension and momentum |
| Visual-Verbal Synthesis | visual-verbal.md | Writing in publishing context |
| Rewrite Discipline | rewrite-process.md | 20+ iteration methodology |

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
EVALUATING COPY
    │
    ├─→ Run Three Rules Test
    │     │
    │     ├─→ Can't visualize? → Zoom-In Technique
    │     │
    │     ├─→ Can't falsify? → Falsifiability Filter
    │     │
    │     └─→ Competitor could sign? → Find unique angle
    │
    ├─→ Still feels flat? → Inject conflict
    │
    ├─→ Too long? → Kaplan's Law (cut non-working words)
    │
    └─→ Final check → One Mississippi Test

CREATING COPY
    │
    ├─→ Start with facts (never invent then hunt)
    │
    ├─→ Write in visual context (Figma, not Word)
    │
    ├─→ Rewrite 15-20 times minimum
    │
    ├─→ Apply Three Rules Test
    │
    └─→ Garden Walk → Final edit → Ship
```

## Quick Start

1. **Hour 1**: Apply Three Rules Test to 5 existing ads. Score each 0-3.
2. **Hour 2**: Zoom-In Technique on your homepage headline.
3. **Hour 3**: Falsifiability Filter on your product description.
4. **Day 1 Complete**: One piece of copy passes all three rules.

## Key Principles

### The Dirty Tap Theory
Quality doesn't come from writing well initially—it comes from writing badly long enough that the "dirty water" clears. Let the tap run. First drafts should be loose.

### Design + Copy Are One
Never separate writing from visual context. Newsletter copy in ConvertKit. Ads in Figma. What you see while writing = what reader sees.

### Kaplan's Law of Words
Every word is either working for the message or actively against it. No neutral words. Maximum density or nothing.

### Two-Line Maximum
No paragraph exceeds two lines. Creates "monkey bars" readers swing between effortlessly.
