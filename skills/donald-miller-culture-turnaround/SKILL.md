# Donald Miller - Culture Turnaround Mastery

Transform organizational cultures from losing to winning through strategic messaging, obsessive documentation, and identity-first transformation methodology.

## Overview

Donald Miller's culture turnaround system reveals that transformation is fundamentally a *messaging campaign*. Identity change precedes behavioral change, and identity is installed through obsessively repeated sound bites that become the operating system of an organization.

**Core Insight**: Language creates reality. What you repeat becomes what people believe and eventually what they become.

**The Inviolable Sequence**:
```
Plan → Belief → Sound Bites → Identity → Behavior → Performance → Results
```

## Quick Start

### 24-Hour Quickstart
1. Diagnose losing beliefs → p01-culture-diagnosis
2. Create PEACE sound bites → p02-peace-sound-bite-architecture
3. Deploy leader sound bites immediately

### 7-Day Sprint
- Days 1-2: Diagnosis + PEACE sound bite creation
- Days 3-4: Leader identity installation + venue mapping
- Days 5-6: Obsessive repetition begins
- Day 7: First identity shift check

### 30-Day Transformation
- Week 1: Foundation (diagnosis + leader identity)
- Week 2: Installation (sound bite deployment)
- Week 3: Acceleration (venue saturation + documentation)
- Week 4: Consolidation (culture shift visible)

## Key Principles

1. **Identity-First**: Never try to change results directly. Change language first.
2. **Sound Bites Are Infrastructure**: Not motivational fluff—they program minds through repetition.
3. **Leader Carries Belief**: Leader must believe before anyone else does.
4. **Obsessive Documentation**: Winners have written it all down.
5. **Kill the Past**: Don't rebuild—start over.
6. **Pressure is Privilege**: Every burden is evidence of being chosen.
7. **Unsurprised by Success**: Winners don't celebrate like lottery winners.
