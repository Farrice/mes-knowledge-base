# Donald Miller - Hidden Knowledge Revealed

Tacit knowledge points extracted from deep pattern analysis.

## Tacit Knowledge 1: Sound Bites Are Cultural Infrastructure

Sound bites are not motivational fluff—they are *cultural infrastructure*. They literally program the operating system of human minds through repetition. Treat them with the same rigor as technical infrastructure.

**Deploy**: Engineer sound bites like you'd engineer software—with intention, testing, and iteration.

## Tacit Knowledge 2: The Sequence Is Inviolable

The sequence cannot be skipped: Plan → Belief → Sound bites → Identity change → Behavior change → Performance change → Results change. 

Skipping steps guarantees failure. Most leaders try to change behavior directly—this never works.

**Deploy**: Always start at the language level, not the behavior level.

## Tacit Knowledge 3: Certainty Outperforms Strategy

When belief is fragile, leader confidence steadies people more than perfect plans. Clarity mobilizes action more than completeness.

People will follow certainty. They won't follow "we're figuring it out."

**Deploy**: Project certainty even when strategy is incomplete. Certainty first, details later.

## Tacit Knowledge 4: Leader Identity Defense Comes First

The leader must defend their own identity *first* before transferring winning identity to others. Cignetti's "I win. Google me" was self-defense before it was team installation.

**Deploy**: Install your own winning beliefs before trying to install them in others.

## Tacit Knowledge 5: Every Resistance Force Is A Privilege

Every resistance force against your business is a *privilege*—competition, attention spans, expiring inventory, bad hires, personal drama. The challenge is the gift that grows you.

**Deploy**: Reframe every complaint as evidence of being chosen for something meaningful.

## Tacit Knowledge 6: Great Leaders Speak Reality Into Existence

Great leaders don't accept old stories—they speak new ones into existence. Identity rewriting is the core function of transformational leadership.

The question isn't "what is true?" but "what will be true because I declared it?"

**Deploy**: Stop describing reality. Start declaring the reality you're creating.
