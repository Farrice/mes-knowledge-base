## Execution Protocol

1. **DESIGN** Problem Section - hook by naming unacceptable reality
2. **CRAFT** Empathy Section - demonstrate understanding of pain
3. **BUILD** Answer Section - present offer as the path forward
4. **CREATE** Change Section - declare the identity shift available
5. **ARCHITECT** End Result Section - paint vision of transformed state

## Output Deliverable

PEACE Sales Copy Architecture:

- End Result Section (vision of transformation)
- Section-by-Section Word Count Recommendations
- Sound Bites Embedded Throughout
