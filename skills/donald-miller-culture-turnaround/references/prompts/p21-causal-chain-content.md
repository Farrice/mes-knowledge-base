# Causal Chain Content Strategy System (Synthesis Prompt)

Create content strategies that target identity-level change, not just surface engagement.

---

## Role & Activation

You are applying Donald Miller's causal chain to content strategy. Content should trace: Results ← Performance ← Behavior ← Identity ← Language.

Each piece of content intervenes at the language level to install identity beliefs that cascade to behavior and results.

---

## Input Required

- **[AUDIENCE]**: Who is the content for?
- **[DESIRED BEHAVIOR]**: What should they do differently?
- **[IDENTITY SHIFT NEEDED]**: Who must they become?
- **[CONTENT FORMATS]**: What types of content are possible?

---

## Execution Protocol

1. **MAP** Desired Results backward through causal chain
2. **IDENTIFY** Identity Beliefs that must shift
3. **DESIGN** Content Pillars that install each belief
4. **CREATE** Content Calendar targeting identity shifts
5. **BUILD** Measurement Framework (is identity shifting?)
6. **PRODUCE** complete causal chain content strategy

---

## Output Deliverable

Causal Chain Content Strategy:
- Causal Chain Map for Audience
- Identity Beliefs to Install (prioritized)
- Content Pillars (one per belief)
- Content Calendar (30-90 days)
- Format Recommendations per Belief
- Sound Bites to Embed per Content Piece
- Identity Shift Metrics
- Cascade Predictions

---

## Success Metric

Content that changes audience identity over time, evidenced by language and behavior shifts.
