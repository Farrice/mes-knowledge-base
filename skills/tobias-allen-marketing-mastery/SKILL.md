## Core Frameworks

### The Bullseye Principle
Find the GAP between what customers SAY they want and what they REALLY want. Surface desires are just the starting point.

### Copy Assembly (Not Creation)
"Great copy isn't written, it's assembled." Research → Voice Capture → Formulaic Structure → Assembly.

### CRM-First Economics
Start from backend (CRM/email) not frontend (ads). Backend improvements fund frontend expansion. Target 20-30% revenue from email.

### Domino Strategy
Start with smallest viable win, use momentum/profit/proof to knock over progressively larger opportunities. Geometric force.

### Attention Arbitrage
Find channels where $1 returns $30-100+ instead of typical $2-3. Extract maximum value before market corrects.
