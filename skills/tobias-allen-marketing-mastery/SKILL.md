## Core Frameworks

### The Bullseye Principle
People have a reason for buying that SOUNDS good, and a REAL reason that drives the purchase. The gap between these two is where marketing leverage lives. Cialis outsold Viagra by discovering the bullseye: married men weren't buying for sex—they were buying for intimacy with their partners.

### Copy Assembly (Not Creation)
Copywriting is ASSEMBLY from researched components, not creative generation. Capture exact customer language, document features → benefits → transformations, organize into formulaic structures, and assemble. The 80/20 research ratio eliminates creative guesswork.

### CRM-First Economics
Start optimization from the backend (email/CRM should generate 20-30% of revenue), because every dollar of efficiency gained directly funds more aggressive frontend acquisition. A business making $3/subscriber can outspend a $0.50/subscriber competitor.

### The Domino Strategy
Geometric growth through sequential wins. A domino can topple one 1.5x its size—exponential force through sequential wins. Start with the smallest winnable domino. Each win funds, enables, and creates momentum for the next.

### Attention Arbitrage
Constantly scan for channels where $1 returns $30-100+ instead of typical $2-3. Study historical arbitrage patterns. Extract maximum value from underpriced channels before the market corrects.

### The Translation Test
Copy that can be translated into 37 languages without losing power is better copy. The constraint forces clarity and directness. If your headline requires clever wordplay to work, it's fragile.

### Economics Unlock Marketing
Marketing problems are often economics problems in disguise. Fix unit economics first, then marketing becomes a lever instead of a cost center.

### Behavioral Residue Engineering
Products and campaigns that leave visible, shareable traces create organic word-of-mouth automatically. Make the invisible visible—attach behavioral markers that spark conversations.
