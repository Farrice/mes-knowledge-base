## Pattern 1: The Bullseye Principle

**What He Does Unconsciously**: Automatically searches for the GAP between what customers SAY they want and what they REALLY want. Surface-level research is merely the starting point.

**Deployment**: Conduct two layers of investigation: (1) explicit desires people openly state, (2) hidden motivations discovered through nuanced observation. The bullseye is the insight that makes customers feel "finally, someone understands."

**Case Study**: Cialis vs Viagra. Viagra marketed sex loudly. Cialis discovered through 6 months of research that buyers were married men wanting intimacy with partners. Cialis outsold the incumbent.

## Pattern 2: Copy Assembly (Not Creation)

**What He Does Unconsciously**: Frames copywriting as ASSEMBLY from pre-existing components rather than creative generation.

**Deployment**:
1. Capture exact customer language (tone, phrases, concerns)
2. Document product features → benefits → transformations
3. Organize into formulaic landing page structure
4. Assemble components into coherent sales argument

**Success Metric**: Copy that sounds like it came from the customer's mind, not the marketer's.

## Pattern 3: CRM-First Economics

**What He Does Unconsciously**: Starts optimization from BACKEND (CRM/email) rather than frontend (ads), because backend improvements fund frontend expansion.

**Deployment**:
1. Audit email revenue as % of total (target: 20-30%)
2. Optimize welcome sequences for conversion
3. Build post-purchase ascension automations
4. Reinvest margin gains into landing page improvements
5. Use improved economics to outspend competitors on ads

---

## Pattern 4: Domino Strategy

**What He Does Unconsciously**: Applies principles of geometric growth from nature to marketing architecture.

**Deployment**: Start with smallest viable win, use momentum/profit/proof to knock over progressively larger opportunities. A small domino can topple one 1.5x its size—exponential force.

**Success Metric**: Each marketing win enables a disproportionately larger next win.

---

## Pattern 5: Attention Arbitrage Hunting

**What He Does Unconsciously**: Constantly scans for channels where $1 returns $30-100+ instead of typical $2-3.

**Deployment**:
1. Study historical arbitrage examples (comic book ads, early podcast sponsorships)
2. Identify underpriced attention channels competitors haven't discovered
3. Test aggressively when you find potential arbitrage
4. Extract maximum value before market corrects

---

## Pattern 6: Behavioral Residue Engineering

**What He Does Unconsciously**: Designs products/campaigns with built-in visibility mechanisms that create word-of-mouth automatically.

**Deployment**: Ask "How can we make the invisible visible?" Attach physical/behavioral markers that spark conversations.

**Case Study**: Livestrong yellow bands—donation becomes visible, wearable, talkable.

---

## Pattern 7: Scale-Appropriate Strategy Selection

**What He Does Unconsciously**: Instantly calibrates advice based on company size.

**Deployment**:
- Under $10M: Focus on distribution
- $10M-$100M: Balance distribution with conversion optimization
- $100M+: Double down on conversion, efficiency, international expansion
- Eliminate tactics that don't move the needle at current scale

---

## Pattern 8: Research Pain Tolerance

**What He Does Unconsciously**: Accepts extraordinary research burden BEFORE writing. The "painful" process IS the competitive advantage—others won't do it.

**Deployment**: For high-stakes campaigns, commit to exhaustive research: read/watch ALL available content, categorize themes, map the complete narrative landscape before writing.

**Success Metric**: You can predict how the expert would answer any question in their domain.
