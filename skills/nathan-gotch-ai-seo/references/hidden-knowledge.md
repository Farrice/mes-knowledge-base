6 tacit insights for AI SEO domination.

---

## 1. Retrieval ≠ Ranking
**Insight**: AI search works fundamentally differently—it retrieves and synthesizes rather than ranks. Optimizing for ranking misses the retrieval layer entirely.
**Deploy**: Before any SEO work, map the retrieval layer first.

## 2. Unlinked Mentions Count
**Insight**: Traditional SEO valued backlinks. AI SEO values mentions—even without links. Brand mention = citation fuel.
**Deploy**: Pursue unlinked mentions as actively as backlinks.

## 3. Knowledge Base Is the Lead Domino
**Insight**: Everything else (content, citations, tools) depends on organized knowledge. Without it, AI can't help you scale.
**Deploy**: Build knowledge base BEFORE creating content.

## 4. Platform Weights Are 80/20
**Insight**: 5-10 platforms determine 80%+ of AI's citation decisions. Most optimization wastes resources on irrelevant platforms.
**Deploy**: Identify top 5-10 platforms, ignore the rest.

## 5. 15% Human Layer Is Non-Negotiable
**Insight**: AI content is detectable. The "what AI can't fake" layer (original data, real experience) is what AI engines trust.
**Deploy**: Every piece needs 15% uniquely human content.

## 6. Coding Is the Multiplier
**Insight**: AI coding (Replit, Cursor) lets small teams ship tools that previously required developers. This is leverage at scale.
**Deploy**: Invest in AI coding skills or hire for them.
