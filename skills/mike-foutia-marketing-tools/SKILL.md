## Core Frameworks

### Three-Layer Research Escalation
Intelligence follows three layers: **Layer 1** (raw metrics: views, volume, engagement) → **Layer 2** (semantic analysis: themes, angles, pain points, language patterns) → **Layer 3** (strategic synthesis: opportunities, gaps, content angles). Never skip layers. Applied universally across any data source.

### Organic-to-Paid Bridge
Organic virality is free market research. What's trending organically reveals validated messaging, hooks, and angles — then you fast-follow with paid ads using those proven patterns.

### Automation Boundary Heuristic
Before automating anything, ask: "Will the output be consistently brand-safe at scale?" Text research and writing → automate. Video and creative visuals → keep human in the loop. The four automation levels: A1 (Full Auto) → A2 (AI Draft + Human Polish) → A3 (AI Assist + Human Lead) → A4 (Human Only).

### Brand Bible Context Injection
Every AI-generated output is filtered through a pre-built brand context document (tone, audience, pain points, differentiators). Without it, AI produces mean-reversion content. With it, outputs are brand-differentiated.

### Non-Coder Builder Pattern (Vibe Coding)
Prototype in low-code (N8N, Make), identify limitations, then vibe-code a custom version using Claude Code / Cursor. Ship internal tools, not SaaS products. Build time is hours, not weeks.
