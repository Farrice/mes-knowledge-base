# Shaan Puri Storytelling

Transform content from information delivery into emotion transfer using systematic storytelling architecture.

## Overview

Shaan Puri's methodology reverse-engineers mastery from non-writers (comedians, screenwriters, performers) and packages it into deployable systems. The core insight: content is emotion transfer. Every piece has one job—make the reader feel something so powerfully they must share it.

**Core Philosophy:** "I'm a merchant of feelings."

## Deployable Capabilities

| Capability | Prompt | Use Case |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Intention + Obstacle | intention-obstacle.md | Structuring any story |
| 5-Second Moment | transformation-moment.md | Finding the change point |
| Frame Reframing | frame-reframe.md | Creating unexpected angles |
| Binge Bank Audit | binge-bank.md | Evaluating content portfolio |
| Jenny Visualization | jenny-bedroom.md | Writing to one person |
| Emotion Reverse-Engineer | emotion-first.md | Starting with target feeling |
| Surprise = Humor | humor-construction.md | Building jokes |

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
CREATING CONTENT
    │
    ├─→ What emotion should reader feel? (Define first)
    │
    ├─→ What's the story structure?
    │     ├─→ What does character want? (Intention)
    │     └─→ What's blocking them? (Obstacle)
    │
    ├─→ Where's the transformation?
    │     └─→ Find the 5-second moment of change
    │
    ├─→ What's the frame?
    │     └─→ Reframe before writing hooks
    │
    └─→ Who am I writing to?
          └─→ Jenny in her bedroom (one person)
```

## Quick Start

1. **Hour 1**: Define target emotion (LOL, WTF, OMG, AWW)
2. **Hour 2**: Find Intention + Obstacle structure
3. **Hour 3**: Locate 5-second transformation moment
4. **Day 1 Complete**: One piece that delivers target emotion

## Key Principles

### The Dirty Tap Theory
Quality comes from writing badly long enough that the "dirty water" clears. First drafts should be loose. Let the tap run.

### Frame > Hook
Spend 80% on reframing ideas, 20% on wordsmithing. A brilliant frame makes hooks write themselves.

### State Before Create
Get into peak state BEFORE creating. Energy transfers through the screen. Never create while cold.
