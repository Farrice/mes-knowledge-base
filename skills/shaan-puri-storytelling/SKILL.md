# Shaan Puri Storytelling Mastery

> Transform content from information delivery into emotion transfer using systematic storytelling architecture.

## Overview

Shaan Puri's methodology reverse-engineers mastery from non-writers (comedians, screenwriters, performers) and packages it into deployable systems. The core insight: **content is emotion transfer**. Every piece has one job—make the reader feel something so powerfully they must share it.

**Core Philosophy:** *"I'm a merchant of feelings."*

**What Made Shaan Revolutionary:**
1. Content is Emotion Transfer, Not Information Delivery
2. Frame Dominance Over Word Craft
3. Cross-Pollination Mastery (studies comedians, not business writers)
4. Low-Status Connection Strategy
5. Systematized Intuition

## Core Frameworks

### Frame > Hook Hierarchy
Spend 80% on reframing ideas, 20% on wordsmithing. A brilliant frame makes hooks write themselves.

### Intention + Obstacle
Every story: "[Character] wants [specific thing] but [specific obstacle] is blocking them."

### Merchant of Feelings Model
Define target emotion (LOL, WTF, OMG, AWW) and reverse-engineer content to produce it.

### The 5-Second Moment
Find the exact pivot point—the moment where transformation became inevitable.

### Low-Status Opening
Lead with vulnerability, not credentials. Connection before impression.

### Binge Bank Investment
Create for the moment someone "goes down your rabbit hole."
