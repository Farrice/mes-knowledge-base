# Shaan Puri - Genius Patterns

## Core Philosophy

Story is transformation. Every story is a yin-yang—whatever state exists at the beginning, the opposite exists at the end.

---

## Pattern 1: Intention + Obstacle Architecture

**The Pattern**: Every compelling story has a clear intention (what the protagonist wants) and a clear obstacle (what's blocking them). This creates the engine that pulls readers through.

**Why It Works**: Readers need to know what to root for. Without intention, there's no investment. Without obstacle, there's no tension.

## Pattern 2: The 5-Second Moment

**The Pattern**: Find the exact pivot point—the moment of decision, realization, or action where transformation became inevitable. Render it vividly.

**Why It Works**: This is the heart of the story. Average stories gloss over it; great stories live in it.

---

## Pattern 3: Frame > Hook

**The Pattern**: Great hooks don't come from wordsmithing—they come from finding the right frame. An average idea brilliantly framed beats a brilliant idea poorly framed.

**Why It Works**: Frames change how information is processed. The same content, differently framed, creates completely different reactions.

---

## Pattern 4: Merchant of Feelings

**The Pattern**: Define ONE signature feeling and deliver it consistently across all content. You're not selling information—you're selling an emotional state.

**Why It Works**: Brands that own a feeling create irrational loyalty. Customers can't articulate why they love you, but they do.

## Pattern 5: Jenny in Her Bedroom

**The Pattern**: Visualize ONE specific person in their physical and emotional context when creating content. Not a demographic—a person.

**Why It Works**: Content for a specific person resonates with millions. Content for millions resonates with no one.

---

## Pattern 6: Low-Status Opening

**The Pattern**: Begin with vulnerability or relatability, not credentials. Connection before impression.

**Why It Works**: High-status openings trigger skepticism. Low-status openings create connection and trust before you make your point.

---

## Pattern 7: Nested Story Persuasion

**The Pattern**: Multiple unrelated stories that reveal a single principle. Let the audience discover the conclusion themselves.

**Why It Works**: Direct argument triggers resistance. Self-discovered conclusions drive higher conviction.

---

## Pattern 8: State Before Create

**The Pattern**: Get into peak emotional state before creating. Your emotional state transfers through your output.

**Why It Works**: Energy is contagious. If you're bored writing it, they'll be bored reading it.

## The Quality Tests

### The Yin-Yang Test
Does the end state contrast sharply with the beginning state?

### The Intention Test  
Can you state in one sentence what the protagonist wants?

### The 5-Second Test
Is there a vivid pivot point you could describe in 5 seconds?

### The Feel Test
Do you feel something when you read your own work?
