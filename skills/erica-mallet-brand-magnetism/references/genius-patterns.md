# Erica Mallet - Genius Patterns

## Pattern 1: Belief-First Brand Architecture
**Execute**: Start with 3 themes that capture your worldview. Under each theme, articulate 3 specific beliefs. These 9 beliefs become your content foundation.

**Success Metric**: Can generate infinite content ideas from belief matrix.

---

## Pattern 2: The Enemy Effect
**Execute**: Name a specific enemy (not a person, but a force/system/approach). Content attacking this enemy creates instant tribal belonging.

**Success Metric**: Comments include "finally someone said it."

---

## Pattern 3: Through-Line Discovery
**Execute**: List every skill, experience, and interest. Find the thread that connects them ALL—this becomes your unique positioning.

**Success Metric**: Positioning sounds inevitable once discovered.

---

## Pattern 4: Expectation Violation Differentiation
**Execute**: List 15 expectations for someone in your category. Document which you violate. These violations = differentiation.

**Success Metric**: People describe you as "different from other [category]."

---

## Pattern 5: Vegetable-in-Cake Packaging
**Execute**: Never post beliefs directly. Hide them inside entertaining stories, frameworks, or examples that deliver the belief as insight.

**Success Metric**: Audience absorbs worldview without feeling preached at.

---

## Pattern 6: Four Psychological Loops
**Execute**: Deploy 4 loop types: WHO (who is this?), WHEN (when will I find out?), HOW MUCH (how big?), WHY (what caused this?).

**Success Metric**: Audience watches/reads to completion.

---

## Pattern 7: The 5-Year Conversation Test
**Execute**: Before adopting a theme, ask: "Could I talk about this for 5 years without getting bored?" If no, it's not a core theme.

**Success Metric**: Energy increases when discussing themes.

---

## Pattern 8: Physical Response as Data
**Execute**: Notice physical sensations when considering topics/directions. Excitement, energy, revulsion—these are valid data points.

**Success Metric**: Decisions aligned with energy produce better outcomes.

---

## Pattern 9: Duo Differentiation Shortcut
**Execute**: Combine two identities rarely seen together. The combination itself becomes differentiation.

**Success Metric**: Easy to describe in "X meets Y" formula.

---

## Pattern 10: Connection Over Attention
**Execute**: Optimize for depth of relationship, not breadth of reach. 1000 true fans > 100,000 casual followers.

**Success Metric**: DMs, replies, and purchases from same people repeatedly.

---

## Pattern 11: Tone Word Quality Filter
**Execute**: Define 3 tone words. Run all content through filter: does this sound [word1], [word2], [word3]?

**Success Metric**: Brand voice instantly recognizable without seeing name.

---

## Pattern 12: Cringe Mountain Navigation
**Execute**: Accept that putting yourself out there feels cringey initially. Success requires crossing this mountain.

**Success Metric**: What felt cringey becomes comfortable through repetition.

---

## Pattern 13: Gary Vee Repetition Pattern
**Execute**: Repeat core beliefs until YOU are bored. That's when audience is just starting to absorb them.

**Success Metric**: Audience can predict your takes before you make them.

---

## Pattern 14: IKEA Effect for Audience
**Execute**: Let audience "choose their own ending" in content. Participation creates ownership and investment.

**Success Metric**: Higher comment volume as audience interacts.

---

## Pattern 15: Open Lane Detection
**Execute**: When discovering your positioning, ask: "Is anyone FAMOUS for this exact combination?" If no, you found an open lane.

**Success Metric**: No obvious direct competitor.
