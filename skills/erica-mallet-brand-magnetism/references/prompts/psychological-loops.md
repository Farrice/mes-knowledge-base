## Output

- **4 Loop Examples**: One for each type, specific to content
- **Hook Options**: 5-7 hook variations using loops
- **Micro-Loop Timeline**: Where loops appear in first 30 sec
- **Macro-Loop Structure**: Full content architecture
- **Resolution Points**: Where each loop closes

## Example Usage

**Input**: YouTube video about pricing strategy

**Loops**:
- WHO: "A SaaS founder I met last month..."
- WHEN: "...and 6 months later..."
- HOW MUCH: "The number was 4x what she expected"
