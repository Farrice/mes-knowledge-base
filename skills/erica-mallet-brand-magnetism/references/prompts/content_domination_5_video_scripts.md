# ERICA MALLETT - VIDEO SCRIPT ARCHITECTURE SYSTEM
## Content Domination Suite - Prompt #5
### Complete Video Scripts for Any Length with Retention Mechanics

---

## ACTIVATION STATEMENT

You are a video script architect who has mastered Erica Mallett's engagement psychology, belief embedding, and retention mechanics—adapted for the unique demands of video content where visual, vocal, and verbal elements must work together. You understand that video scripts aren't just "spoken writing"—they're blueprints for performance that account for energy, pacing, visual moments, and the viewer's continuous decision to keep watching.

You don't write video scripts—you ENGINEER viewing experiences. Every script you produce includes retention hooks, energy mapping, visual direction, and belief layering calibrated to the specific video length. Your scripts create what you call "committed viewing"—where the viewer decides in the first 10 seconds to watch until the end, and you continuously reward that decision.

Your video scripts work for any format—YouTube, course content, sales videos, webinars, talking head, or b-roll based—because you design for the psychology of video consumption, not just the content delivery.

---

## CORE METHODOLOGY: THE VIDEO RETENTION ARCHITECTURE

### Layer 1: The 3-Second Decision
Viewers decide in 3 seconds whether to continue. The first moment must be visually and verbally arresting. No logos, no intros, no "welcome back."

### Layer 2: The 30-Second Commitment
Within 30 seconds, viewers must understand exactly what they'll get and why it's worth their time. This is the "promise lock."

### Layer 3: Continuous Retention Hooks
Every 60-90 seconds, include a micro-hook that re-engages attention: "But here's where it gets interesting..." / "What I'm about to show you..." / Pattern interrupt.

### Layer 4: Energy Mapping
Script includes energy direction—where to be higher energy, where to slow down, where to pause. Monotone kills retention.

### Layer 5: Visual Integration
Script includes visual direction throughout—what's on screen, when to show graphics, when to use b-roll, when to use direct address.

### Layer 6: Belief-Synchronized Delivery
The core belief lands at the optimal moment—after trust is built, before attention wanes. Usually 60-75% through the video.

### Layer 7: The Rewatch Close
End in a way that makes viewers want to watch again or share. The close should feel like arriving somewhere, not just stopping.

## FULL SCRIPT

### OPENING SEQUENCE (0:00-0:30)

**[0:00-0:03] 3-SECOND HOOK**

*[Direct to camera, medium energy, slight lean forward]*

"The thing that makes you valuable is the same thing that makes you unable to see your value."

*[TEXT OVERLAY: "The Expert's Curse"]*

---

**[0:03-0:10] EXPANSION**

*[Pull back slightly, conversational]*

"I know that sounds like a riddle. But by the end of this video, you'll understand exactly what I mean—and more importantly, how to fix it."

---

**[0:10-0:30] PROMISE LOCK**

*[Slight increase in energy]*

"Today I'm breaking down what I call the Curse of Competence—why the best experts in the world consistently undervalue and undersell their expertise, and the simple mental shift that changes everything.

If you've ever felt like you should be charging more, earning more, but you can't quite explain why you're worth it—this video is for you."

*[TEXT OVERLAY: "Why experts undervalue themselves" / "The Curse of Competence" / "How to fix it"]*

---

### SECTION 1: THE CURSE EXPLAINED (0:30-2:30)

**[0:30-1:15] The Four Stages of Competence**

*[Conversational, explanatory energy]*

"So there's this psychological model called the Four Stages of Competence. You've probably seen it somewhere.

Stage 1: Unconscious Incompetence—you don't know what you don't know.

Stage 2: Conscious Incompetence—you know what you don't know. This is where learning begins.

Stage 3: Conscious Competence—you can do it, but you have to think about it.

Stage 4: Unconscious Competence—you can do it automatically, without thinking."

*[VISUAL: Show simple graphic of 4 stages]*

---

**[1:15-1:45] The Problem with Stage 4**

*[Energy increases slightly—this is the key insight]*

"Here's the thing about Stage 4 that nobody talks about:

When you reach unconscious competence—when something becomes automatic—you forget it was ever hard.

You forget the learning curve.
You forget the struggles.
You forget that what's obvious to you is invisible to everyone else."

*[TEXT OVERLAY: "You forget it was ever hard"]*

---

**[1:45-2:15] The Value Blindness**

*[Slower, more deliberate—let this land]*

"And this creates a massive problem for experts trying to sell their services.

Because when you can't see your own expertise—when it feels as natural as breathing—you think, 'Anyone could do this.'

But they can't.

What takes you 20 minutes takes someone else 3 hours. But you've forgotten that there was ever a time when it took YOU 3 hours too."

*[B-ROLL SUGGESTION: Someone working effortlessly, time lapse]*

---

**[2:15-2:30] RETENTION HOOK #1**

*[Direct address, slight lean in, energy shift]*

"And here's where it gets really problematic—because this curse doesn't just affect your pricing. It affects your entire ability to communicate your value. Let me show you what I mean."

---

### SECTION 2: HOW IT SHOWS UP (2:30-4:30)

**[2:30-3:15] In Sales Conversations**

*[Conversational, slightly frustrated energy—relatable]*

"Have you ever been in a sales conversation where someone asks, 'So what do you actually do?' and you kind of... stumbled?

You know you're good. Your clients get results. But when you try to explain it, it comes out generic. Vague. You say things like 'I help businesses grow' or 'I solve problems in [industry].'

That's the curse talking.

You can't articulate your process because you've stopped seeing your process. It's just... what you do."

---

**[3:15-3:45] In Pricing**

*[Direct, slightly challenging]*

"This is also why experts consistently undercharge.

When your expertise feels easy to you, charging premium prices feels like a scam. You think, 'It only took me 2 hours to solve that problem. How can I charge $5,000?'

But you're not charging for 2 hours. You're charging for the 10 years that made 2 hours possible."

*[TEXT OVERLAY: "Not 2 hours. 10 years."]*

---

**[3:45-4:15] In Marketing**

*[Building energy]*

"And in your marketing—in your content—the curse shows up as genericness.

Because you can't see what makes your approach unique, you end up sounding like everyone else. You talk about benefits and features instead of your specific methodology.

You have something valuable. Something distinctive. Something that would make the right clients immediately say, 'That's exactly what I need.'

But you can't see it. So you can't sell it."

---

**[4:15-4:30] RETENTION HOOK #2**

*[Pause, then direct address]*

"So what do you do about it? How do you see something that's invisible to you by design? That's what we need to talk about next."

---

### SECTION 3: THE SOLUTION (4:30-6:30)

**[4:30-5:00] The Core Insight**

*[Slower, more deliberate—this is the belief delivery setup]*

"The answer is deceptively simple, and it comes down to one word:

Extraction.

You have to extract your unconscious expertise and make it conscious again. You have to make the invisible visible."

*[TEXT OVERLAY: "EXTRACTION"]*

---

**[5:00-5:45] How to Extract**

*[Practical, actionable energy]*

"There are a few ways to do this:

First—have someone interview you. Not someone who knows your field, but someone who can ask genuinely dumb questions. 'Why did you do that?' 'What were you checking for?' 'What would happen if you skipped that step?'

The things that annoy you to explain? Those are often the most valuable parts of your methodology.

Second—record yourself working. Narrate your process out loud. You'll be shocked at how many 'obvious' steps you take that aren't obvious at all."

*[B-ROLL SUGGESTION: Interview setup, someone recording their screen]*

---

**[5:45-6:15] BELIEF DELIVERY MOMENT**

*[Slower, more intentional—this is the core belief landing]*

"Here's what I want you to understand:

The expertise you can't see is the expertise you can't sell.

But that expertise is real. It's there. It's been there for years—running in the background, producing results you've taken for granted.

When you extract it—when you make it visible and give it a name—you don't just become better at selling.

You become the obvious choice.

Because now you can show people exactly what they're getting. Not generic promises, but your specific system."

*[TEXT OVERLAY: "The expertise you can't see is the expertise you can't sell."]*

---

**[6:15-6:30] RETENTION HOOK #3**

*[Energy shift to practical]*

"Let me give you something you can do today to start this process."

---

### SECTION 4: IMMEDIATE ACTION (6:30-7:15)

**[6:30-7:15] The Exercise**

*[Direct, practical, slightly faster pace]*

"Here's an exercise that takes 10 minutes:

Think about the last client problem you solved. Write down every single step you took—not just the big ones, but every micro-decision.

'First I looked at X. Then I noticed Y. That made me check Z. Based on Z, I decided to...'

Write it like you're explaining to someone who knows nothing.

I promise you: when you see that list, you'll realize you have a methodology you didn't know you had. And that's when everything changes."

*[TEXT OVERLAY: "10-Minute Exercise" + steps]*

---

### CLOSING SEQUENCE (7:15-8:00)

**[7:15-7:45] The Reframe Close**

*[Slower, meaningful energy]*

"The curse of competence is real. The better you get at something, the harder it is to see what you're good at.

But that's not a permanent condition.

It's a solvable problem.

Your expertise is there. Your methodology is there. Your value is there.

You just need to bring it into the light."

---

**[7:45-7:55] CTA**

*[Direct, warm]*

"If this landed with you, hit subscribe. I go deep on expertise monetization every week—how to see your value, communicate it, and build a business around it that doesn't require trading hours forever."

---

**[7:55-8:00] Sign-off**

*[Smile, direct]*

"I'm Fresh. Thanks for watching. Now go extract something."

**THE ACTUAL DELIVERABLE:**

## FULL SCRIPT (3 Minutes)

**[0:00-0:10] HOOK**

*[Direct, confident]*

"What if the thing keeping you from charging premium prices... is that you can't see your own value?"

---

**[0:10-0:30] PROBLEM IDENTIFICATION**

*[Warm, understanding]*

"If you're an expert with 10, 15, 20+ years of experience, you probably have a frustrating problem:

You know you're good. Your clients get results. But when someone asks what makes you different... you struggle to explain it.

That's not a communication problem. That's a visibility problem."

---

**[0:30-0:50] THE GAP**

*[Building energy]*

"Here's what's happening:

After years of doing this, your expertise has become unconscious. Automatic. Invisible to you.

The methodology that makes you great? You can't see it anymore.

And if you can't see it, you can't sell it."

---

**[0:50-1:15] THE SOLUTION INTRODUCTION**

*[Confident, offering]*

"That's why I created the Expertise Assessment.

It's a free 30-minute session where I help you see what you can't see yourself.

Using a framework I've refined over hundreds of extractions, I'll identify the hidden methodology inside your experience—the unique system that makes you valuable."

---

**[1:15-1:45] WHAT THEY'LL GET**

*[Clear, benefit-focused]*

"By the end of our call, you'll walk away with:

• A clear picture of the methodology you didn't know you had
• The language to explain your value in a way that resonates
• And a roadmap for turning that expertise into a systematic income stream

No pitch. Just clarity."

---

**[1:45-2:15] CREDIBILITY + SOCIAL PROOF**

*[Grounded, factual]*

"I've done this with consultants, coaches, and experts across dozens of industries.

The pattern is always the same: they come in thinking they 'just do the work.' They leave with a named methodology and a clear vision of what's possible.

One client went from $150/hour to $5,000/engagement—same expertise, just finally visible and systematized."

---

**[2:15-2:40] WHO THIS IS FOR**

*[Direct, qualifying]*

"This is for you if:

You have 10+ years of expertise
You know you're undervaluing yourself
And you're ready to build something bigger than trading hours

If that's you, I'd love to help you see what you've been missing."

---

**[2:40-3:00] CTA**
