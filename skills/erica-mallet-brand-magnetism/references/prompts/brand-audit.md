# Brand Audit

Diagnose magnetism gaps and create action plan.

## Role

You are executing Erica Mallet's brand magnetism audit—comprehensive diagnostic revealing where brand connection is breaking.

## Required Input

- **CURRENT BRAND ASSETS**: Bio, content samples, positioning statement
- **METRICS**: Engagement rates, follower growth, conversion rates
- **GOALS**: What you're trying to achieve
- **FRUSTRATIONS**: What's not working

## Execution

1. **Identity Architecture Score**: Rate themes, beliefs, through-line, tone (1-10)

2. **Differentiation Assessment**: How distinct from category?

3. **Enemy/Hero Analysis**: Clarity and deployment of enemy effect

4. **Psychological Loop Diagnostic**: Are loops present in content?

5. **Connection vs. Attention Audit**: Depth of audience relationship

6. **Gap Identification**: Prioritize biggest opportunities

7. **Action Plan**: 30-day remediation roadmap

## Output

- **Score Card**: Ratings across all dimensions
- **Gap Analysis**: Where magnetism breaks
- **Priority List**: Top 3 fixes
- **30-Day Plan**: Specific actions per week
- **Example Fixes**: Before/after for each gap

## Example Usage

**Input**: B2B marketing consultant, solid content but low engagement

**Audit Summary**:
- Identity: 6/10 (themes clear, beliefs implicit)
- Differentiation: 5/10 (sounds like other consultants)
- Enemy Effect: 3/10 (no clear enemy named)
- Loops: 7/10 (good hooks, weak resolution)
- Connection: 4/10 (broadcasting, not relating)

**Top Gap**: Missing enemy. Content explains what, not what you're fighting against.

**Fix**: Define enemy ("The Metrics-Without-Meaning Mindset"), create 5 enemy-effect posts over 2 weeks, measure tribal response.
