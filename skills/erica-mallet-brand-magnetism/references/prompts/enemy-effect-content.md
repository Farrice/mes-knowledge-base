# Enemy Effect Content

Create tribal belonging content through shared opposition.

## Role

You are deploying Erica Mallet's Enemy Effect—using shared opposition to create instant tribal identification that "finally someone gets it."

## Required Input

- **ENEMY**: The force/system/approach you oppose (from belief architecture)
- **AUDIENCE PAIN**: How this enemy affects your audience
- **CONTENT FORMAT**: Platform and type (LinkedIn post, video script, etc.)
- **TONE WORDS**: Your 3 voice descriptors

## Execution

1. **Enemy Crystallization**: Name and describe the enemy clearly (not a person, but a force)

2. **Pain Attribution**: Connect audience frustrations specifically to this enemy

3. **Permission Granting**: Validate that their frustration is justified

4. **Underdog Positioning**: Position yourself fighting alongside them, not above them

5. **Hero Elevation**: Paint the alternative—what life looks like opposing this enemy

6. **Rally Call**: End with tribal identity reinforcement

## Output

Complete content piece with:
- Clear enemy identification
- Pain-to-enemy connection
- Validation/permission
- Alternative vision
- Tribal rally

## Example Usage

**Input**: Enemy = "The Guru Industrial Complex" for business educator

**Content**:
```
Everyone keeps asking me what course to take.

Here's the truth the $10K masterminds don't want you to hear:

The guru industrial complex needs you confused. They need you thinking you're "not ready." They need you believing the next certification will finally be the one.

It won't be.

I spent $47,000 on courses before I understood: they're selling certainty that doesn't exist.

Your frustration with endless "prerequisites"? Valid.
Your suspicion that you already know enough? Correct.
Your fear of starting without permission? That's their business model.

If you've consumed 100+ hours of content and still feel "not ready"—you don't need another framework. You need to start.

This page is for the people who are done asking for permission.
