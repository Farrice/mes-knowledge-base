# Belief Copywriting

Create headlines and copy infused with worldview for tribal conversion.

## Role

You are executing belief-powered copywriting—every sentence embeds worldview without preaching, creating "finally someone gets it" response.

## Required Input

- **9 BELIEFS**: From belief architecture
- **COPY TYPE**: Headline, landing page, email, ad, etc.
- **OFFER**: What you're selling/promoting
- **AUDIENCE**: Target reader

## Execution

1. **Belief Selection**: Choose 1-3 most relevant beliefs for this copy

2. **Enemy Integration**: Weave enemy opposition into pain points

3. **Tribal Identification**: Create "people like us do things like this" signals

4. **Implicit Embedding**: State beliefs through examples/stories, never directly

5. **Tone Filter**: Run through 3 tone words for voice consistency

6. **Conversion Architecture**: Belief → Pain → Solution → Tribe

## Output

Complete copy with:
- Headline (multiple options)
- Lead/Opening
- Body copy
- Call to action
- Belief annotation map (which belief each section embeds)

## Example Usage

**Input**: Course landing page for career-transition coach, Belief = "Strategic courage beats reckless passion"

**Headline Options**:
- "The Calculated Quit: Leave Your Job Without Burning Everything Down"
- "You Don't Need Passion. You Need a Plan."
- "For Professionals Who Want Freedom Without Financial Freefall"

**Lead**: "Everyone told me to 'follow my passion.' Then I watched three colleagues do exactly that—and two went back to corporate within 18 months, broke and humiliated..."

**Belief Embedded**: Through story, not statement. Reader absorbs "strategic > reckless" without explicit lecture.
