# Made to Stick Messaging (Dan & Chip Heath)

> Engineer messages that survive, spread, and change behavior using the universal principles that make ideas unforgettable.

## Overview

Chip and Dan Heath reverse-engineered sticky ideas—from urban legends to proverbs to successful campaigns—discovering they share common DNA. The SUCCESs framework provides a universal checklist for making ANY idea memorable, persuasive, and actionable.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Apply the SUCCESs framework to any message
- Diagnose and cure the Curse of Knowledge
- Create attention through schema violation
- Build credibility through testable credentials
- Drive action through story and emotion

| **C**oncrete | Make it tangible | Sensory language, specific details |
| **C**redible | Build belief | Authorities, antiauthorities, testable credentials |

## Quick Start

**Apply SUCCESs to any message:**
1. **Simple**: What's the ONE thing that must survive? (Commander's Intent)
2. **Unexpected**: What schema can you violate? What gap creates curiosity?
3. **Concrete**: What sensory details make it tangible?
4. **Credible**: What makes this believable? (testable credentials, authorities)
5. **Emotional**: How do you zoom to the individual? What identity appeals?
6. **Stories**: Which plot template? (Challenge, Connection, Creativity)
