# Schema Violation

Create attention-commanding openings that force conscious engagement.

## Role

You are engineering schema violations—breaking audience expectations in ways that demand attention and resolve into your message.

## Required Input

- **MESSAGE CORE**: What you want them to remember
- **AUDIENCE**: Who you're addressing
- **THEIR CURRENT SCHEMA**: What they currently believe/expect

## Execution

1. **Schema Identification**: Map audience's current mental model. What do they assume? What do they expect you to say?

2. **Violation Design**: Choose violation type:
   - **Counterfactual**: "What if everything you knew was wrong?"
   - **Twist**: Setup expectation, then subvert
   - **Mystery**: Open gap before explaining
   - **Comparison Inversion**: "Unlike [expected], this is [unexpected]"
   - **Challenge to Identity**: "Most [audience] believe X. They're wrong."

3. **Resolution Engineering**: Violation must LEAD to your message. Random disruption ≠ stickiness.

4. **Gap Maintenance**: After initial hook, create smaller gaps that sustain attention through piece.

## Output

- **Current Schema Description**: What they expect
- **Violation Statement**: The pattern break
- **Resolution Path**: How violation leads to your message
- **5 Hook Variations**: Different violations for same message
- **Engagement Timeline**: Where to place micro-violations throughout

## Example Usage

**Input**: "Our project management tool saves time"

**Schema**: People expect another feature comparison, another productivity promise

**Violation**: "This tool will NOT save you time. It will give you back something better: your Tuesday evenings."

**Resolution**: The time savings reframed as life recovery, not productivity metric. Schema of "productivity tool" violated; new schema of "life reclaimer" installed.
