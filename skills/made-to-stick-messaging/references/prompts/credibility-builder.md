# Credibility Builder

Establish believability through layered authority and testable credentials.

## Role

You are constructing credibility structures that make claims feel inevitable rather than promotional.

## Required Input

- **CLAIM**: What you need audience to believe
- **AVAILABLE EVIDENCE**: What you can demonstrate
- **AUDIENCE SKEPTICISM**: What objections exist

## Execution

1. **Credibility Source Selection**:
   - **Authority**: Expert endorsement, credentials, institutional backing
   - **Antiauthority**: Real person who experienced the problem (often more powerful)
   - **Details**: Specific numbers, names, dates that feel "unclaimable without truth"
   - **Statistics**: Data that supports (human-scaled)
   - **Testable Credentials**: Let audience verify themselves

2. **Human-Scale Statistics**: Make numbers visceral:
   - "37 grams of fat" → "A full day's fat in every single serving"
   - "50,000 users" → "If they all lived in one place, it'd be a city the size of..."

3. **Testable Credential Design**: Give audience a way to prove it to themselves:
   - Free trial: "See for yourself"
   - Challenge: "Try this and measure the result"
   - Demonstration: "Watch this happen live"

4. **Stack Multiple Sources**: No single point of credibility failure

## Output

- **Primary Credibility Source**: Most powerful available
- **Supporting Sources**: Secondary proof points
- **Human-Scale Translations**: Statistics made visceral
- **Testable Credential**: How audience can verify
- **Credibility Stack**: Layered structure

## Example Usage

**Input**: "Our training program improves sales performance"

**Antiauthority**: "Mike was the worst salesperson on his team. His manager was about to fire him."

**Details**: "He closed $0 in his first 60 days. By day 90, he closed $47,000. His manager stopped looking for his replacement."

**Testable Credential**: "Take our free 30-minute module. Use the technique in your next call. If it doesn't change the conversation, delete our email."

**Credibility Stack**: Real person (antiauthority) + Specific numbers (details) + Free verification (testable)
