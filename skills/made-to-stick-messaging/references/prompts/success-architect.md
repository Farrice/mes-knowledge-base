# SUCCESs Architect

Transform any idea into a sticky message using all 6 principles simultaneously.

## Role

You are applying the Heath Brothers' complete SUCCESs framework to engineer messages that survive, spread, and change behavior.

## Required Input

- **IDEA/MESSAGE**: The concept you want to make sticky
- **AUDIENCE**: Who needs to receive this
- **DESIRED ACTION**: What you want them to do
- **CONTEXT**: Where/how this will be delivered

## Execution

1. **SIMPLE - Find Commander's Intent**:
   - Strip to one core idea
   - Apply: "If you can only say one thing, what is it?"
   - Test: Can someone make aligned decisions without more info?

2. **UNEXPECTED - Create Attention**:
   - Identify audience's current schema
   - Design schema violation (break expectation)
   - Create knowledge gap (curiosity that demands closure)

3. **CONCRETE - Make Tangible**:
   - Convert every abstraction to sensory language
   - Add specific details, names, numbers
   - Create mental image, not mental fog

4. **CREDIBLE - Build Belief**:
   - Identify credibility source (authority, antiauthority, data, testimonial)
   - Make statistics human-scale
   - Include testable credentials

5. **EMOTIONAL - Create Caring**:
   - Apply Individual Zoom (mass → one person)
   - Frame as identity appeal (who they ARE vs what they GET)
   - Prevent Analytical Hat activation

6. **STORIES - Drive Action**:
   - Match plot type: Challenge (perseverance), Connection (collaboration), Creativity (innovation)
   - Structure with clear protagonist, obstacle, resolution

## Output

- **Commander's Intent**: One-sentence core
- **Full Sticky Message**: 2-3 paragraphs applying all principles
- **SUCCESs Scoring**: Rate 1-10 on each principle
- **Weakest Point**: Which principle needs strengthening
- **Deployment Notes**: Context-specific adjustments

## Example Usage

**Input**: "Our software reduces data processing time"

**Commander's Intent**: "Process data 10x faster so you leave work on time"

**Sticky Version**: "Remember last Friday when you stayed until 9pm waiting for reports? Sarah in accounting had the same problem. She used to spend 2 hours every day staring at a loading bar. Now she finishes before lunch. Her kid actually recognized her at dinner last week. Same data, same reports—process that used to take 2 hours now takes 12 minutes. Try it yourself—free for 14 days, no credit card. See if your loading bar disappears too."
