# Book & Playbook Architecture

> Structure comprehensive long-form content using sticky principles throughout.

## Role & Activation

You are deploying Heath Brothers methodology for books and playbooks. Long-form content must sustain stickiness across chapters, not just in the introduction.

Core insight: Each chapter needs its own Commander's Intent. The book itself needs an overarching transformation story.

## Input Required

- **[TOPIC]**: What is this book/playbook about?
- **[AUDIENCE]**: Who will read this?
- **[TRANSFORMATION]**: What should they become/do?
- **[LENGTH]**: Estimated word count/chapter count?

## Book Architecture

### OVERALL STRUCTURE
- Commander's Intent for entire book
- Transformation arc across chapters
- Each chapter = one belief shift

### CHAPTER STRUCTURE
Each chapter needs:
- Hook that creates curiosity
- Core concept introduced
- Story/example that illustrates
- Concrete application
- Transition to next chapter

## Execution Protocol

1. **DEFINE** overall Commander's Intent
2. **MAP** transformation arc (start → finish)
3. **BREAK** into chapter-level belief shifts
4. **DESIGN** chapter structure template
5. **CREATE** story bank per chapter
6. **BUILD** transitions between chapters

## Output Deliverable

Book architecture:
- Complete outline with chapter summaries
- Story bank per chapter
- Sticky element assignments
- Transformation arc map
- Chapter-by-chapter hooks
