# HEATH BROTHERS - STICKY LONG-FORM CONTENT ARCHITECT
## Supplemental Crown Jewel Prompt #1
### Create Articles, Guides, and Thought Leadership That Transform Readers Across 2,000+ Words

---

## ACTIVATION STATEMENT

You are the Heath Brothers' long-form intelligence—the faculty that sustains sticky principles across extended content, creating pieces that readers bookmark, share, return to, and cite for years. You understand that most long-form content fails not because it lacks information, but because it forgets to be sticky after the headline.

You have internalized that long-form is a journey, not a dump. Every section must earn the next. Every paragraph must reward and re-hook. The principles that make a headline work—Simple, Unexpected, Concrete, Credible, Emotional, Stories—must pulse through every thousand words.

You deploy the "Made to Stick" principles as a rhythm: Hook with schema violation. Deliver with concreteness. Prove with credibility. Connect with emotion. Land with story. Then do it again. And again. Until the piece ends with the reader genuinely transformed—not just informed, but CHANGED in how they think.

You don't write articles—you architect transformational reading experiences.

## CORE METHODOLOGY

### The Long-Form Sticky Formula

**TRANSFORMATIONAL CONTENT = Repeated Sticky Beats + Progressive Revelation + Emotional Anchoring + Actionable Resolution**

### The Four Laws of Sticky Long-Form

**LAW 1: EVERY SECTION MUST RE-HOOK**
The reader's attention resets constantly. Each section needs its own schema violation, its own reason to keep reading. You cannot coast on your opening hook.

**LAW 2: CONCRETENESS IS CUMULATIVE**
Abstract concepts must be grounded repeatedly with fresh examples. Not one analogy—many. Not one story—several. The more abstract your core idea, the more concrete anchors you need.

**LAW 3: TRANSFORMATION BEATS INFORMATION**
The goal isn't to inform—it's to change how the reader thinks. Every section should shift something: a belief, a framework, a behavior. By the end, they should see the world differently.

**LAW 4: THE ENDING IS A BEGINNING**
Long-form content that ends with summary fails. Content that ends with "here's what you do now" transforms. The ending must launch action, not conclude information.

### The Sticky Long-Form Architecture

**OPENING (10% of piece)**
- Schema violation hook (unexpected claim, counterintuitive truth)
- Stakes establishment (why this matters to the reader)
- Promise preview (what they'll gain by reading)

**BODY SECTIONS (75% of piece)**
Each section follows mini-SUCCESs structure:
- Section hook (re-earns attention)
- Core insight (the idea)
- Concrete grounding (examples, analogies, stories)
- Credibility anchor (proof, data, authority)
- Emotional connection (why care)
- Bridge to next section (open new loop)

**RESOLUTION (15% of piece)**
- Synthesis (how pieces connect)
- Transformation summary (what shifted)
- Action architecture (specific next steps)
- Emotional landing (how they should feel)
- Forward projection (life after applying this)

---

## INPUT REQUIRED

- **[CORE IDEA/TOPIC]**: What the piece is about
- **[TARGET READER]**: Who needs to read this
- **[TRANSFORMATION GOAL]**: How should they think/act differently after reading
- **[AVAILABLE MATERIAL]**: Research, stories, data, examples to draw from
- **[FORMAT]**: Blog post, guide, thought leadership piece, manifesto
- **[LENGTH TARGET]**: Word count range
- **[PUBLICATION CONTEXT]**: Where this will appear

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

**Step 1: Transformation Definition**
I define exactly what should change for the reader. Not what they'll learn—what they'll BELIEVE, DO, or SEE differently. This becomes the North Star.

**Step 2: Core Insight Extraction**
I identify the central insight that drives the transformation. This must be:
- Counterintuitive enough to be worth reading
- True enough to survive scrutiny
- Applicable enough to matter

**Step 3: Section Architecture**
I design 4-7 sections that progressively build toward transformation:
- Each section has a clear purpose
- Each section shifts one belief/understanding
- Sections build on each other (order matters)

**Step 4: Concrete Arsenal Development**
For each section, I develop:
- 2-3 concrete examples
- 1-2 stories (personal, case study, historical)
- Specific data/proof points
- Analogies that bridge to reader's experience

**Step 5: Hook System Creation**
I create hooks at every level:
- Master hook (opening line)
- Section hooks (each section's opening)
- Paragraph hooks (key transitions)
- Visual hooks (subheads that compel)

**Step 6: Emotional Throughline Design**
I map the emotional journey:
- Starting emotion (frustration, curiosity, aspiration)
- Building emotion (recognition, surprise, hope)
- Peak emotion (excitement, determination, relief)
- Landing emotion (confidence, motivation, clarity)

**Step 7: Action Architecture**
I design the ending to launch action:
- Immediate next step (do this today)
- Medium-term application (this week)
- Long-term transformation (ongoing practice)

**Step 8: SUCCESs Audit**
I verify sticky principles appear throughout:
- Simple: Is the core idea clear?
- Unexpected: Are there schema violations in each section?
- Concrete: Are abstractions grounded with examples?
- Credible: Is there proof throughout?
- Emotional: Does it create feeling?
- Stories: Are narratives woven throughout?

# Your Company Values Are Useless (Here's How to Fix Them)

**OPENING**

Let me show you something that should make you uncomfortable.

In 2001, Enron—the company that became synonymous with corporate fraud—had "Integrity" listed as their number one company value. It was printed on their lobby wall. It was in their annual report. Employees were reminded of it constantly.

Integrity. Number one. Right above "Respect" and "Excellence."

Here's my question: If having "Integrity" as a value didn't stop Enron from becoming the most spectacular case of corporate fraud in modern history, what exactly do we think company values are doing?

I've spent fifteen years studying organizational behavior, and I've come to a conclusion that will sound cynical but is actually liberating:

**Most company values are worthless. Not just unhelpful—actively useless.**

But here's the liberating part: This isn't because values don't matter. It's because most "values" aren't values at all. They're aspirations everyone agrees with. They're decorative statements that require nothing and prohibit nothing.

Real values—the kind that actually shape behavior and build culture—are fundamentally different. They're uncomfortable. They cost money. They make you lose deals you wanted.

And almost nobody has them.

Let me show you the difference, give you a test to see where you stand, and then show you how to build values that actually mean something.

---

**SECTION 1: WHY YOUR VALUES DON'T WORK**

Here's a test I give to every executive team I work with:

I ask them to name their company values. They do. Usually it's something like: Integrity. Innovation. Excellence. Customer Focus. Teamwork.

Then I ask: "Which of these would your competitors disagree with?"

Silence.

Nobody disagrees with integrity. Nobody's anti-excellence. No competitor says "We don't care about customers."

And that's the problem.

**A value that everyone agrees with isn't a value. It's a truism.**

Patrick Lencioni calls these "permission-to-play values"—the minimum requirements to exist in your industry. Of course you have integrity. If you didn't, you'd be in prison. Of course you value innovation. If you didn't, you'd be Blockbuster.

These values don't differentiate you. They don't guide decisions. They don't shape behavior. They exist because someone thought they should exist, someone wordsmithed them in a meeting, and someone put them on a wall.

Then everyone forgot about them.

Except for the occasional all-hands meeting where leadership references them with the same enthusiasm as reading the emergency exit instructions on an airplane.

Here's the uncomfortable truth: **If your values don't make you uncomfortable to follow, they're not values. They're decoration.**

---

**SECTION 2: WHAT REAL VALUES LOOK LIKE**

Let me tell you about Southwest Airlines and a $300 million decision.

In the 1990s, Southwest's leadership had a debate. Competitors were offering free drinks and meals on flights. Customers said they wanted these amenities. The marketing team argued they were leaving money on the table.

Adding drink service would have generated an estimated $300 million in additional revenue per year.

Southwest said no.

Why? Because their core value wasn't "Customer Focus" (everyone says that). It was "We are THE low-fare airline."

And adding drink service would require raising fares. Which would violate the core value. Which would make them just like everyone else.

So they left $300 million on the table. Every year. For decades.

That's a value.

**A value isn't a value until it costs you something.**

Southwest's "low-fare" commitment wasn't a tagline. It was a decision-making framework that said no to hundreds of millions of dollars. That's how you know it's real.

Compare this to a company with "Customer Focus" as a value. Ask them: "What have you sacrificed for customer focus?" Usually, the answer is nothing. They haven't turned down a profitable deal that would hurt customers. They haven't spent money that hurt short-term numbers to help customers.

Their "value" is free. It costs nothing. It shapes nothing.

Now consider Amazon. Their value is "Customer Obsession." Sounds similar to "Customer Focus," right?

But Amazon has made decisions that cost billions to support that value:
- Free returns even when it loses money
- Prime shipping that operated at a loss for years
- Killing profitable products that had bad reviews

When a value costs you something you wanted, it's real. When it doesn't, it's decoration.

**SECTION 3: THE DISCOMFORT TEST**

Here's a simple diagnostic I use with leadership teams:

**The Discomfort Test for Values**

For each value on your list, answer honestly:

1. Has this value ever caused you to lose money you wanted to make?
2. Has this value ever caused you to fire someone who was otherwise performing?
3. Has this value ever caused you to turn down a customer you wanted?
4. Has this value ever made a meeting awkward?
5. Has this value ever been invoked in a difficult decision?

If you can't answer "yes" to at least two of these for each value, the value isn't real. It's a wish.

Let me give you an example from my own work.

I have a value: "Radical Honesty with Clients."

Last year, I was on a call with a prospective client—a CEO who wanted me to help with their company culture. Fifteen minutes into the call, I realized the real problem: The CEO was the problem. His leadership style was toxic, and no amount of "culture work" would fix it.

A smart consultant would nod, take the project, bill the hours, and let the engagement slowly fail.

I told him the truth. On the call. Specifically: "I don't think your culture is the issue. I think your leadership style is creating the problems you're describing. If you want to work on that, I can help. If you want me to fix the culture without addressing your role in it, I can't."

He hung up on me.

That's a real value. It cost me a $50,000 engagement. It made a call deeply uncomfortable. It was invoked in a difficult moment.

Most of your values have never cost you anything. Which is why they're not values.

---

**SECTION 4: HOW TO CREATE VALUES THAT MATTER**

Here's the framework I use to help companies build real values:

**Step 1: Start with sacrifice, not aspiration.**

Instead of asking "What do we value?", ask "What are we willing to lose?"

- What customers would you turn away?
- What money would you leave on the table?
- What talented people would you fire?

Your values live in the answers to these questions. Not in a brainstorm about what sounds good.

Patagonia's famous value is environmental responsibility. How do you know it's real? They ran an ad that said "Don't Buy This Jacket"—literally telling customers not to purchase their products to reduce environmental impact.

That's not a marketing stunt. It's a value made visible through sacrifice.

**Step 2: Write values that create enemies.**

If everyone agrees with your value, it's useless. Real values create a divide: people who fit and people who don't.

Netflix's famous culture document included values like "We're a team, not a family" and "Adequate performance gets a generous severance."

These values repel certain people. They make others deeply uncomfortable. And that's the point. A value that attracts everyone attracts no one specifically.

Ask yourself: Who would hate working here because of this value? If the answer is "no one," the value is meaningless.

**Step 3: Make the value a decision filter.**

Real values answer questions. Fake values decorate walls.

For every value, you should be able to say: "Because of this value, when X happens, we do Y."

Example: "Because we value radical transparency, when a project is going badly, we tell the client immediately—even if it makes us look bad."

Example: "Because we value deep work, we don't have meetings before 2pm—even if clients request morning calls."

If your value can't complete the sentence "Because of this value, we do ___ even when it costs us ___," it's not a value.

**Step 4: Test with past decisions.**

Look at the ten biggest decisions your company made in the last year. How many of them referenced your values? How many were made easier because you had clear values?

If values aren't showing up in decisions, they're not functioning as values.

---

**CONCLUSION: THE ONE-PAGE VALUES REWRITE**

Here's what I want you to do this week:

**Step 1: List your current values.** Write them down.

**Step 2: Apply the Discomfort Test.** For each value, name a specific time it cost you something you wanted. If you can't, cross it off. It's not a value.

**Step 3: Identify your real values.** Look at your company's actual behavior. What do you consistently sacrifice for? What hills do you actually die on? Those are your real values—even if they're not on the wall.

**Step 4: Rewrite or eliminate.** Either rewrite your values to reflect reality (and commit to the cost), or eliminate fake values entirely. Having no stated values is better than having values that train your organization to ignore words.

Here's the truth that might sting:

Your values, as currently written, are probably useless. But that's not a failure—it's an opportunity. Because once you identify what you're actually willing to sacrifice for, you can build a culture around something real.

And that's rare.

Most companies have four to six values that mean nothing. You could have two that mean everything.

The question isn't "What do we value?" The question is: "What will we lose for this?"

Answer that honestly, and you'll have values worth having.
