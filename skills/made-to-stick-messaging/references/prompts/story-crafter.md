## Execution

1. **Plot Selection**: Match story type to desired action:
   - **Challenge Plot**: Protagonist overcomes obstacles → Inspires PERSEVERANCE
   - **Connection Plot**: Relationships form across gaps → Inspires COLLABORATION  
   - **Creativity Plot**: Mental breakthrough solves problem → Inspires INNOVATION

2. **Story Structure**: Every story needs:
   - **Protagonist**: Clear person to follow
   - **Obstacle**: What stands in the way
   - **Stakes**: What's at risk
   - **Resolution**: How it ends
   - **Lesson**: What this means for audience

3. **Simulation Trigger**: Stories work because audiences SIMULATE being the protagonist. Build sympathy, then show action they can emulate.

## Example Usage

**Input**: Inspire sales team to persist through rejection

**Plot Type**: Challenge (obstacles → perseverance)

**Story**: "In 1995, a salesman named Jack had failed 47 pitches in a row. His manager told him one more miss and he was done. Pitch 48 was a hardware store owner in Iowa who said no before Jack finished his first sentence. Jack asked if he could just finish the sentence. The owner said yes. That sentence became a $400 million company. You know it as Home Depot's biggest supplier. Forty-seven rejections were training for pitch 48."

**Action Connection**: Your next rejection isn't a failure—it's practice for the one that matters.
