# Made to Stick - Genius Patterns

## Pattern 1: Commander's Intent (Finding the Core)
**Execute**: Strip away everything until you find the ONE thing. If you can only communicate one thing, what would it be? That's your Commander's Intent.

**Success Metric**: Decision-makers can make aligned choices without additional clarification.

## Pattern 2: Schema Violation for Attention
**Execute**: Identify audience's existing mental model (schema). Create violation that breaks expectations. Resolution delivers your message.

**Success Metric**: Audience stops, pays conscious attention, remembers.

---

## Pattern 3: Knowledge Gap Creation
**Execute**: Open a gap between what they know and what they want to know. The gap creates curiosity that demands closure. Maintain gaps across content.

**Success Metric**: Audience continues consuming until gap is closed.

---

## Pattern 4: Curse of Knowledge Reversal
**Execute**: Identify your expert assumptions (jargon, context, steps you skip). Translate each assumption into language for someone with zero background.

**Success Metric**: Complete novices understand AND take correct action.

---

## Pattern 5: Concrete Over Abstract
**Execute**: Replace every abstract word with sensory-specific language. "Improve performance" → "Cut processing time from 2 hours to 12 minutes."

**Success Metric**: Message creates mental image, not mental fog.

---

## Pattern 6: Testable Credentials
**Execute**: Instead of claiming authority, give audience a way to verify for themselves. "Try this free before you buy" beats "Trust our expertise."

**Success Metric**: Audience convinces themselves rather than being told.

---

## Pattern 7: Human-Scale Statistics
**Execute**: Make numbers relatable to human experience. "37 grams of fat" → "A full day's fat in every serving." Anchor to known quantities.

**Success Metric**: Audience FEELS the number, not just reads it.

---

## Pattern 8: The Individual Zoom
**Execute**: Move from statistics about masses to story about ONE person. "Millions affected" → "Meet Sarah, who..." The individual activates emotions; the mass numbs.

**Success Metric**: Audience takes action they wouldn't take for statistics alone.

---

## Pattern 9: Identity Over Self-Interest
**Execute**: Frame appeal as "this is who you ARE" rather than "this is what you GET." People act consistently with identity even when it costs them.

**Success Metric**: Behavior change that persists without constant reinforcement.

---

## Pattern 10: Three Universal Story Plots
**Execute**: Identify which plot template fits your message:
- **Challenge**: Protagonist overcomes obstacles (inspires perseverance)
- **Connection**: Relationships across gaps (inspires collaboration)
- **Creativity**: Mental breakthrough (inspires innovation)

**Success Metric**: Audience is inspired to take specific corresponding action.
