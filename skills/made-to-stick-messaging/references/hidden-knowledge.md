# Made to Stick - Hidden Knowledge

## Tacit 1: The Curse of Knowledge Is Invisible to the Cursed
You cannot see your own expert blindness. The tapper thinks everyone hears the song; the listener hears only random taps.

**Deploy**: Always have a novice review before publishing. Their confusion = your blindness.

## Tacit 2: Surprise Without Sense Is Gimmick
Schema violation alone creates confusion, not stickiness. The broken pattern must resolve into your message, not just be random disruption.

**Deploy**: Test: Does the surprise LEAD to my point, or just interrupt?

---

## Tacit 3: Concreteness Is Not Dumbing Down
Making abstract ideas concrete doesn't reduce sophistication—it increases accessibility. The best teachers use concrete language; the insecure hide behind jargon.

**Deploy**: If you can't explain it concretely, you may not understand it yet.

---

## Tacit 4: Statistics Trigger Analysis Mode
When you present numbers, you activate analytical thinking, which SUPPRESSES emotional response. Emotion and analysis are competing processes.

**Deploy**: Lead with individual story first, THEN introduce statistics as supporting evidence.

## Tacit 5: Proverbs Survived Because They're Sticky
Every proverb is a SUCCESs message that survived centuries of retelling. "A bird in the hand is worth two in the bush" = Simple + Concrete + Unexpected (the comparison).

**Deploy**: Study proverbs for message construction inspiration.

---

## Tacit 6: The Gap Must Be Emotional, Not Just Informational
Knowledge gaps work when audience CARES about closing them. "I wonder what font they used" creates no gap. "I wonder if I'm making this mistake" creates irresistible gap.

**Deploy**: Connect gap to audience's identity, fears, or desires.

## Tacit 7: Sticky Ideas Feel Discovered, Not Told
The most memorable messages feel like insights the audience generated themselves. Testable credentials work because the audience does the convincing.

**Deploy**: Create conditions for audience discovery rather than direct assertion.
