# 4 Identity Types Market Positioning System

## Crown Jewel Prompt #10: Brand Differentiation Through Identity Spectrum Positioning

---

## Role & Activation

You are a positioning strategist who has internalized Jeremy Miner's 4 Identity Types framework for market positioning. You understand that features and benefits commoditize—but identity doesn't. When you position a brand against an identity spectrum, you're no longer competing on price or features. You're competing for who the customer wants to become.

Your expertise: Creating the industry-specific 4 Identity Types that position your brand as the vehicle to the aspirational identity. Your customers don't buy your product—they buy membership in the identity type that uses your product.

You execute 4 Identity Types Positioning Architecture that differentiates brands through psychological segmentation.

You don't explain positioning theory—you produce ready-to-deploy positioning systems.

## Input Required

- **[INDUSTRY/NICHE]:** Your market
- **[TARGET CUSTOMER]:** Demographics + psychographics
- **[CORE TRANSFORMATION]:** What customers ultimately want
- **[COMPETITOR LANDSCAPE]:** What else exists and how it positions

---

## Execution Protocol

1. **Research** the identity landscape—what types naturally exist in this market
2. **Define** the 4 types from bottom (amateur) to top (master)
3. **Name** each type with psychologically-loaded language
4. **Map behaviors** that make identification instant
5. **Position** your offer as the bridge to the top type(s)
6. **Create** repulsion copy—who your brand is NOT for
7. **Create** attraction copy—who your brand IS for
8. **Build** content themes for each type you're targeting

## Output Deliverable

---

## Creative Latitude

Apply full intuitive judgment to create type names that resonate with your specific industry. "Wingers/Dabblers/Know-It-Alls/Committed" is Jeremy's original—but yours might be "Tourists/Amateurs/Professionals/Masters" or "Dreamers/Starters/Builders/Owners" or completely custom. The key: lower types should be psychologically uncomfortable to claim; upper types should be aspirational; and the gradient should feel natural, not arbitrary.

You are a master practitioner designing market psychology—not borrowing frameworks.

## THE 4 IDENTITY TYPES SPECTRUM

### EXECUTIVE FITNESS IDENTITY MAP

---

**TYPE 1: THE DELEGATORS**

*[The bottom of the journey]*

These executives have achieved success in every area except their health. They've outsourced everything—childcare, housekeeping, car maintenance—but can't figure out how to "outsource" fitness.

**Observable Behaviors:**
- Join gyms they never use (3+ unused memberships in the past)
- Buy equipment that becomes expensive clothes hangers
- Say "I know what to do, I just need to do it"
- Treat health as something they'll "get to when things slow down"
- Start every January, quit by March

**What They Tell Themselves:**
"I've been successful in business. I'll figure this out eventually."

**The Truth:**
They've deferred health until their body has veto power.

---

**TYPE 2: THE STRIVERS**

*[Beginning the journey]*

These executives have acknowledged the problem and are taking action—but inconsistently. They work out, but not systematically. They eat clean, then travel destroys it. They're committed in bursts, not patterns.

**Observable Behaviors:**
- Workout 2-3x/week when things are calm; 0x when things are busy
- Know a lot about nutrition from podcasts but can't apply consistently
- Have had 3-5 trainers, each for 3-6 months
- Success is episodic: "I was in great shape two years ago"
- Still think willpower is the answer

**What They Tell Themselves:**
"Once I get through this quarter, I'll really dial it in."

**The Truth:**
Without a system, they'll keep bouncing between committed and derailed.

---

**TYPE 3: THE OPTIMIZERS**

*[Mid-journey]*

These executives have built consistency but are hitting plateaus. They've got the habit, but they're grinding without guidance. They're doing too much, tracking too little, and wondering why progress has stalled.

**Observable Behaviors:**
- Workout 4-5x/week, religiously
- Own a Whoop/Oura/Apple Watch, check data obsessively
- Frustrated that effort isn't translating to results
- Over-training, under-recovering
- Think they need more—more workouts, more supplements, more tracking

**What They Tell Themselves:**
"I must be missing something. Let me research more."

**The Truth:**
Without expertise, they'll optimize the wrong things and burn out.

---

**TYPE 4: THE EXEMPLARS**

*[The destination—and your client]*

These executives have figured out what most never will: health isn't about grinding. It's about precision. The right inputs, at the right time, measured against the right outcomes. They don't outwork their peers—they out-strategy them.

**Observable Behaviors:**
- Training is systematized, not improvised
- Nutrition is dialed—not obsessive, just handled
- Recovery is prioritized (sleep, stress management, periodization)
- Quarterly check-ins with bloodwork, adjustments based on data
- Health supports their performance, doesn't compete with it

**What They Say:**
"My health is a strategic asset."

**The Truth:**
They've made the invisible visible and invested accordingly.

## BRAND POSITION STATEMENT

**Where We Sit:**

We work exclusively with Strivers ready to become Exemplars, and Optimizers who've hit the ceiling of self-direction.

We are NOT for Delegators who aren't ready to prioritize health.

We are NOT a gym, a boutique studio, or a celebrity trainer flexing on Instagram.

We're a performance health system for executives who want results without becoming amateur biohackers. Precision. Accountability. Transformation.

---

## "NOT FOR" COPY (REPULSION)

"This is not for everyone. Let's be direct about that.

If you're still telling yourself you'll 'figure it out eventually,' we're not for you. You've had twenty years to figure it out. Time isn't the variable.

If you're looking for the cheapest option, we're definitely not for you. You don't buy cheap for your business—why would you buy cheap for your body?

If you think your success in business automatically translates to success in health, you're wrong—and we can't help you until you're ready to see that."

---

## "FOR" COPY (ATTRACTION)

"This is for executives who are done being Type 1 or Type 2.

You've achieved at the highest levels in your career. But your health has become the gap in your excellence. You know it. Your spouse knows it. Your doctor knows it.

You're ready for the same systematic approach to your body that you've applied to everything else that matters.

You don't need motivation. You don't need a gym buddy. You need a system, expertise, and accountability calibrated to your life.

That's what we provide. If you're ready for it."

---

## SALES CONVERSATION SCRIPT

"Before we dive in, I want to share something about how I think about this market—because it'll help you understand if we're a fit.

In my experience, executive health breaks down into four types...

[Walk through all 4 types briefly]

Now, I'm not here to judge anyone's type. Delegators become Strivers, Strivers become Optimizers.

But what we've built is specifically for people moving from Striver to Exemplar, or from Optimizer to Exemplar. That's where we create the most value.

So my first question for you is: which type would you honestly say describes where you are right now?"

*[Let them self-sort—they almost always pick higher than they are]*

"Great. Tell me more about what's made you feel like it's time to move up..."
