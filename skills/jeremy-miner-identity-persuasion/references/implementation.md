# Implementation Pathway

Structured timelines for internalizing Jeremy Miner's identity-based persuasion methodology.

---

## 24-Hour Quickstart

**Objective:** Deploy one technique in a real conversation today.

### Hour 1-2: Foundation
- Read [genius-patterns.md](genius-patterns.md) sections 1-3 (Identity-First, Self-Question, Pre-Frame)
- Internalize the core principle: "People do who they believe they are"

### Hour 3-4: Build Your First Tool
- Use [Pre-Frame Formula Generator](prompts/01-pre-frame-formula.md) to create a pre-frame for your main offering
- Write out the exact words you'll use

### Hour 5-6: Prepare the Identity Framework
- Use [4 Identity Types Builder](prompts/03-identity-types-framework.md) to create your industry's 4 types
- Memorize the spectrum names

### Live Deploy (Next Conversation):
1. Open with your pre-frame
2. Introduce the 4 types naturally
3. Ask where they see themselves
4. Observe what happens

**Success Criteria:** You deployed, they engaged differently than usual

## 7-Day Sprint

**Objective:** Functional fluency across core techniques.

### Day 1: Pre-Frame Formula
- Master: [Pre-Frame Formula Generator](prompts/01-pre-frame-formula.md)
- Create 3 different pre-frames for different contexts
- Deploy at least one in a real conversation
- Journal: What shifted in their response?

### Day 2: Self-Question Pattern
- Master: Pattern 2 from [genius-patterns.md](genius-patterns.md)
- Convert 10 statements you normally make into questions
- Deploy in 2+ conversations
- Journal: Did they state YOUR conclusion in THEIR words?

### Day 3: Indirect Frame Constructor
- Master: [Indirect Frame Constructor](prompts/02-indirect-frame.md)
- Create 3 indirect frames for difficult truths you need to deliver
- Deploy in 1+ conversation
- Journal: Was there less resistance than expected?

### Day 4: 4 Identity Types Deep Dive
- Master: [4 Identity Types Builder](prompts/03-identity-types-framework.md)
- Fully elaborate your industry's 4 types
- Create the spectrum visual/narrative
- Practice presenting it conversationally

### Day 5: Objection Prevention Frames
- Master: [Objection Prevention Frame Builder](prompts/04-objection-prevention.md)
- Identify your top 3 objections
- Build prevention frames for each
- Write the exact deployment scripts

### Day 6: Reframe Flips
- Master: [Reframe Flip Generator](prompts/05-reframe-flip.md)
- Map 5 common negatives you hear
- Create flip scripts for each
- Practice until they're automatic

### Day 7: Integration Day
- Review all techniques
- Have one conversation using 3+ techniques
- Record yourself (audio) if possible
- Identify your strongest and weakest technique
- Create a practice plan for Week 2

## 30-Day Transformation

**Objective:** Intuitive mastery—techniques become invisible.

### Week 1: Foundation Mechanics

| Day | Focus | Practice |
|-----|-------|----------|
| 1 | Identity Principle | Read patterns 1-3, journal on identity in your sales |

| 3 | Self-Question Pattern | Convert all claims to questions for 24 hours |
| 4 | 4 Identity Types | Build full framework, present to 1 person |
| 5 | Consequence Stacking | Practice 3-layer stacks in 2 conversations |
| 6 | Pattern Interrupt | Deliberately break expectations 3 times |
| 7 | Integration | Use 3 techniques in one conversation |

### Week 2: Frame Architecture

| Day | Focus | Practice |
|-----|-------|----------|
| 8 | Indirect Frames | Build library of 5 indirect frames |
| 9 | Indirect Deploy | Use indirect frame in difficult conversation |
| 10 | Objection Prevention | Build prevention frames for top 5 objections |
| 11 | Prevention Deploy | Test prevention frames in sales call |
| 12 | Reframe Flips | Create flip scripts for 7 common negatives |
| 13 | Binary Locks | Create 5 lock questions for common identities |
| 14 | Integration | Full sales call using prevention + locks |

### Week 3: Advanced Applications

| Day | Focus | Practice |
|-----|-------|----------|
| 15 | Story Transfer | Create 3 third-person stories for key points |
| 16 | Story Deploy | Tell stories instead of making claims |
| 17 | Tonal Calibration | Record calls, analyze tone patterns |
| 18 | State Management | Practice shifting prospect state through tone |
| 19 | Permission Patterns | Deploy explicit permission asks throughout calls |
| 20 | Future Pacing | Practice painting specific future scenarios |
| 21 | Integration | Full presentation using all Week 3 techniques |

### Week 4: Intuitive Mastery

| Day | Focus | Practice |
|-----|-------|----------|
| 22 | Pattern Recognition | Notice identity conflicts in real-time |
| 23 | Real-Time Adjustment | Shift techniques based on what you observe |
| 24 | Teaching Others | Explain one technique to a colleague |
| 25 | Objection Autopsy | Review lost deals through identity lens |
| 26 | Script Development | Create team training on 3 core techniques |
| 27 | Full Integration | Entire sales process from identity perspective |
| 28 | Reflection | Journal on transformation, identify growth edges |
| 29-30 | Future Planning | Design 90-day mastery continuation |
