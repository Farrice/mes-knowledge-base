# Jeremy Miner: 14 Genius Patterns

Decoded virtuoso behaviors from the NPQ (Neuro Emotional Persuasion Questions) methodology.

---

## Pattern 1: Identity-First Persuasion Architecture

**The Insight:** "People do who they believe they are." Every buying decision is an identity decision.

**Observable Behavior:** Jeremy never argues features against objections. He shifts the frame to identity—making the prospect see themselves as "the type of person who..." before any pitch.

**Executable Version:**
- Before presenting ANY solution, establish what "type of person" makes that decision
- Frame buying as identity-congruent ("People who build businesses...")
- Frame not buying as identity-threatening ("The people who stay stuck...")

**Success Metric:** Prospects use identity language when explaining their decision

---

## Pattern 2: The Self-Question Pattern

**The Insight:** Direct claims trigger skepticism. Questions trigger self-discovery.

**Observable Behavior:** When Jeremy wants the prospect to believe something, he asks a question that leads them to say it themselves. "Have you ever noticed that the people who complain about price are usually the ones who struggle the most?"

**Executable Version:**
- Replace statements with questions
- "This will help you scale" → "What would happen to your business if you could actually scale?"
- Lead them to articulate the conclusion you want them to reach

**Success Metric:** Prospect states the key insight in their own words

---

## Pattern 3: Pre-Frame Everything

**The Insight:** How something is introduced determines how it's received. Context > Content.

**Observable Behavior:** Jeremy precedes EVERY framework, price, or concept with a pre-frame that elevates its perceived value. "What I'm about to share with you is something I only discovered after..."

**Executable Version:**
- Never introduce anything "cold"
- Create anticipation and context before the reveal
- Use scarcity, authority, or transformation pre-frames

**Success Metric:** Audience leans in before you deliver the content

---

## Pattern 4: Indirect Attribution

**The Insight:** Third-person stories bypass resistance that first-person claims trigger.

**Observable Behavior:** "My mentor once told me..." or "A client of mine was exactly where you are..." Jeremy constantly attributes wisdom to third parties, making it feel like observation rather than persuasion.

**Executable Version:**
- Replace "You should..." with "What I've noticed is that people like you..."
- Use mentor stories to deliver difficult truths
- Let the story be the teacher

**Success Metric:** Prospect applies the story's lesson without feeling preached at

---

## Pattern 5: The 4 Identity Types Framework

**The Insight:** Markets aren't demographics—they're identity types. Create a spectrum where everyone wants to be at the top.

**Observable Behavior:** Jeremy segments any market into 4 types (Wingers/Dabblers/Know-It-Alls/Committed to Mastery). Each type carries psychological weight—no one wants to be a Dabbler.

**Executable Version:**
- Create your industry's 4 types
- Name them so lower types are embarrassing and upper types are aspirational
- Ask the prospect where they see themselves (they'll pick higher)

**Success Metric:** Prospect self-identifies with higher type and asks how to get there

---

## Pattern 6: Consequence Stacking

**The Insight:** People avoid pain more than they pursue gain. Stack consequences to amplify motivation.

**Observable Behavior:** Jeremy doesn't ask "What do you want?" He asks "What happens if you don't solve this? And then what happens? And what does that lead to?" Each layer deepens the emotional urgency.

**Executable Version:**
- Ask "What happens if nothing changes?"
- Follow with "And what does THAT lead to?"
- Keep stacking until you hit emotional bedrock (family, legacy, identity)

**Success Metric:** Prospect articulates their own deepest consequences

---

## Pattern 7: Pattern Interrupts

**The Insight:** Predictable = resistible. Break the expected pattern to open the mind.

**Observable Behavior:** Jeremy says the opposite of what's expected. Instead of hyping his value, he downplays: "Look, I don't know if this is even right for you." This creates intrigue and lowers defenses.

**Executable Version:**
- When they expect enthusiasm, be reserved
- When they expect a pitch, ask questions
- When they expect agreement, challenge

**Success Metric:** Prospect says "That's not what I expected" or leans in with curiosity

---

## Pattern 8: Binary Identity Questions

**The Insight:** Either/or questions where both answers confirm the positive identity.

**Observable Behavior:** "Is that persistence something you were born with, or something you developed over time?" Either answer confirms they HAVE persistence. There's no exit from the positive frame.

**Executable Version:**
- After positioning a positive identity, lock it with a binary question
- Structure: "Is [positive trait] something you've always had, or something you built?"
- Both options confirm the trait exists

**Success Metric:** Prospect claims the identity through their answer

---

## Pattern 9: The Reframe Flip

**The Insight:** Every negative contains a positive. Find it and name it.

**Observable Behavior:** "I've tried coaching before and it didn't work" → "So you're the type who keeps investing in themselves even after disappointment. That's rare."

**Executable Version:**
- Hear the complaint, find the strength it implies
- Name that strength explicitly
- Let them claim it as their identity

**Success Metric:** Prospect shifts from defensive to proud within 30 seconds

---

## Pattern 10: Objection Inoculation

**The Insight:** Address objections before they're spoken. Prevention > Handling.

**Observable Behavior:** Jeremy mentions common objections in his pre-frames, positions them as identities of "the wrong type," so prospects don't want to voice them. "Some people say 'I need to think about it'—and between us, that usually means 'no' or 'fear.'"

**Executable Version:**
- Identify your top 3 objections
- Build pre-frames that make voicing them feel like admitting weakness
- Deploy early in the conversation

**Success Metric:** Common objections don't appear, or prospect actively distances from them

---

## Pattern 11: Tonal Calibration

**The Insight:** HOW you say it matters more than WHAT you say. Tone conveys subtext.

**Observable Behavior:** Jeremy matches nervous energy with calm authority. He matches skepticism with curiosity, not defensiveness. His tone communicates safety and competence.

**Executable Version:**
- Mirror emotional state briefly, then lead to your desired state
- Use strategic pauses after key statements
- Slow down for important points, speed up for transitions

**Success Metric:** Prospect's emotional state shifts to match yours

---

## Pattern 12: The Permission Close

**The Insight:** Asking permission creates choice. Choice creates ownership.

**Observable Behavior:** "Would it be okay if I shared something with you?" "Can I ask you a personal question?" Jeremy constantly asks permission, making the prospect feel in control while actually leading them.

**Executable Version:**
- Before any bold statement or personal question, ask permission
- This lowers resistance and creates micro-commitments
- Stack permissions throughout the conversation

**Success Metric:** Prospect feels they chose to engage at every step

---

## Pattern 13: Future Pacing

**The Insight:** Make the transformed future vivid and present.

**Observable Behavior:** Jeremy paints specific future scenarios: "Imagine 6 months from now, you wake up and your calendar isn't full of fires..." He makes the desired outcome tangible and emotionally real.

**Executable Version:**
- After establishing desire, paint a specific future scene
- Include sensory details and emotional states
- Connect it to their stated values and goals

**Success Metric:** Prospect's eyes light up or they verbalize the vision

---

## Pattern 14: Real-Time Pattern Recognition

**The Insight:** Read the room and adjust in real-time. No script survives contact with a real human.

**Observable Behavior:** Jeremy notices micro-expressions, hesitations, and energy shifts. He names them: "I noticed you paused when I mentioned budget—what came up for you there?"

**Executable Version:**
- Watch for incongruence between words and body language
- Name it non-judgmentally when you see it
- Create space for the underlying truth

**Success Metric:** Prospect shares the real concern beneath the surface objection

---

## Integration Note

These patterns compound. A single conversation might use:
1. Pre-Frame Formula (Pattern 3) → 
2. 4 Identity Types (Pattern 5) → 
3. Binary Identity Lock (Pattern 8) → 
4. Consequence Stack (Pattern 6) → 
5. Permission Close (Pattern 12)

Mastery isn't knowing the patterns—it's flowing between them based on what the moment requires.
