# Jeremy Miner: Hidden Knowledge

Six points of tacit expertise that separate surface-level practitioners from true masters.

## Hidden Knowledge 1: Identity Is Upstream of Everything

**The Surface Understanding:** "Use identity language in sales."

**The Deeper Truth:** Identity isn't a *tactic* you deploy—it's the *operating system* that governs all decisions. Every objection is an identity protection. Every "yes" is an identity expansion. When someone says "I need to think about it," they're not lying—they genuinely need to reconcile the purchase with who they believe they are.

**Deployment Guidance:**
- Stop treating objections as logic problems to solve
- Start treating them as identity conflicts to resolve
- Ask yourself: "What identity is this objection protecting?"

**The Shift:** You move from fighting resistance to transforming identity

## Hidden Knowledge 2: Prevention > Handling

**The Surface Understanding:** "Get better at handling objections."

**The Deeper Truth:** Elite persuaders rarely "handle" objections because they *prevent* them from forming. By the time an objection is spoken, you've already lost ground—now you're in a debate. But if you inoculate against the objection in your pre-frame, it never gets voiced. The prospect literally can't say "I need to think about it" after you've positioned that phrase as what fearful people say.

**Deployment Guidance:**
- Map your top 5 objections
- Build pre-frames that make voicing them psychologically expensive
- Deploy these pre-frames in the first 10 minutes of any conversation

**The Shift:** You move from reactive defense to proactive architecture

## Hidden Knowledge 3: Questions Are Statements in Disguise

**The Surface Understanding:** "Ask good questions."

**The Deeper Truth:** Every question contains an embedded presupposition. "What would change if you finally solved this?" presupposes they CAN solve it. "Have you noticed that the most successful people make fast decisions?" presupposes this is true AND that they want to be successful. Jeremy's questions aren't information-gathering—they're belief-installing.

**Deployment Guidance:**
- Before asking any question, identify what belief it presupposes
- Design questions that install the belief you want them to hold
- Let them draw the conclusion by answering YOUR question

**The Shift:** You move from extraction to installation

## Hidden Knowledge 4: Third-Person Bypasses First-Person Defenses

**The Surface Understanding:** "Tell stories."

**The Deeper Truth:** When you say "You should do X," defenses activate. But when you say "My mentor told me something that changed everything..." those same defenses stay down. The brain processes third-person narratives differently—as observation rather than instruction. The prospect identifies with the story's protagonist and adopts their transformation without feeling sold.

**Deployment Guidance:**
- Convert every direct claim into a third-person story
- Use "A client of mine..." or "My mentor said..." as carriers
- Let the story do the teaching; you just open the door

**The Shift:** You move from telling to showing through narrative

## Hidden Knowledge 5: The Binary Lock Is Invisible

**The Surface Understanding:** "Ask either/or questions."

**The Deeper Truth:** The most powerful binary questions have no escape—BOTH answers confirm what you want. "Is your drive something you were born with, or something you built?" Either answer confirms they HAVE drive. The prospect doesn't realize they've just claimed an identity. They think they're answering a casual question. But they've now committed to being "the type who has drive" and will act congruently.

**Deployment Guidance:**
- After establishing any positive identity, immediately lock it with a binary
- Structure: "Is [trait] something you've always had, or something you developed?"
- Both options must confirm the trait exists

**The Shift:** You move from hoping they claim the identity to engineering that they must

## Hidden Knowledge 6: Tone Carries More Than Words

**The Surface Understanding:** "Sound confident."

**The Deeper Truth:** Tone conveys what words cannot say explicitly. When Jeremy says "I don't know if this is right for you" with calm authority, the TONE says "I'm so confident in my value that I don't need you." This anti-pitch paradoxically increases desire. Words are processed consciously; tone is processed unconsciously. The subtext always wins.

**Deployment Guidance:**
- Record yourself and listen to what your TONE communicates
- Practice saying opposite things with the same tone
- Match your tonal subtext to your strategic intent

**The Shift:** You move from saying the right words to conveying the right subtext

## Integration: The Invisible Architecture

Masters don't think about these elements consciously—they've become the water they swim in. The path to mastery:

1. **Conscious Incompetence:** You learn these distinctions exist
2. **Conscious Competence:** You deploy them deliberately
3. **Unconscious Competence:** They become automatic
4. **Reflective Mastery:** You can teach others to see what you now see

The danger zone is Stage 2—when you're so focused on technique that you lose authenticity. Push through. On the other side is flow.
