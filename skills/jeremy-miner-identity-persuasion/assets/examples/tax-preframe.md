## The Pre-Frame Delivered

*[Tone: Conversational, slightly conspiratorial, building energy]*

"Before I show you this, I want to give you some context—because what I'm about to share is something I only talk about with clients who are at a certain level.

*[Pause]*

Most CPAs won't bring this up. Not because it's wrong—it's completely IRS-approved—but because it requires a specific situation and most people either don't qualify or wouldn't implement it correctly.

You qualify. And based on what you just told me about your vacation property... this could be significant.

*[Lean in slightly]*

I had a client last year in almost exactly your situation. Similar business structure, similar property. By the time we finished restructuring, he'd created a $30,000 annual deduction that he'd been leaving on the table for *years*.

And the thing is—once you see it, you'll wonder why no one told you sooner.

*[Transition]*

So here's what the Augusta Rule is, and why it matters for someone in your position..."

## Why This Works

1. **Exclusivity Frame:** "clients who are at a certain level" makes them feel selected
2. **Scarcity Frame:** "Most CPAs won't bring this up" creates insider knowledge feeling
3. **Qualification:** "You qualify" confirms they're in the elite group
4. **Social Proof:** Similar client story makes outcome tangible ($30K)
5. **Anticipation:** "you'll wonder why no one told you sooner" creates curiosity

## Alternative Version (Email Pre-frame)

**Subject:** Something I only share with clients at your level

**Body:**

[Name],

There's a tax strategy I've been meaning to discuss with you—and I've been waiting for the right moment because it's not something I bring up casually.

It's called the Augusta Rule, and it applies to business owners who own vacation properties.

Most CPAs don't mention it. Either they don't know about it, or they assume their clients won't implement it properly.

But given your situation—the business structure you have and the property you mentioned—I think you could be leaving $20,000-$40,000 per year on the table.

I'd like to walk you through how it works when we meet Thursday. Come prepared to have your mind blown a little.

Talk soon,
[Signature]
