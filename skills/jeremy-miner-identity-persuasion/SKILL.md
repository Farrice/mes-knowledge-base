# Jeremy Miner: Identity-Based Persuasion & Psychological Framing

Expert extraction from Jeremy Miner's NPQ (Neuro Emotional Persuasion Questions) methodology, condensed from the "One Sales Skill Separating You From Top Performers" masterclass.

## Overview

Jeremy Miner's core genius rests on one transformative insight: **"People do who they believe they are."** While traditional sales fights resistance through objection handling, Jeremy's methodology *transforms* identity. He doesn't convince people to buy—he helps them become buyers.

This skill provides deployable techniques for:
- Pre-framing any message for maximum perceived value
- Addressing resistance without triggering defensiveness  
- Preventing objections before they form through identity anchoring
- Transforming negatives into positive identity confirmations
- Creating industry-specific identity frameworks that drive action

## The Miner Operating Philosophy

> You cannot convince someone to act against their identity. You can only help them see themselves differently.

Traditional sales fights identity. Jeremy's approach *transforms* identity. This is why his students report that prospects "sell themselves"—because once someone sees themselves as "the type who never gives up" or "committed to mastery," buying becomes identity-congruent rather than identity-threatening.

This is not manipulation. This is helping people become who they want to be—and aligning your offer with that transformation.
