# Nate B. Jones — Agent Deployment Strategy

Deploy AI agents safely and systematically using frameworks derived from OpenClaw ecosystem analysis (145,000+ developers, 3,000+ skills) and every major agent success/failure of 2025-2026.

## Core Insight

> The difference between an agent saving $4,200 on a car and an agent carpet-bombing a contact list is the width of a well-written specification.

## When to Use

- Planning first agent deployment (individual or team)
- Writing agent specifications that prevent predictable failures
- Designing containment architecture for autonomous systems
- Analyzing market demand through revealed preference data
- Building human-agent collaboration workflows
- Briefing stakeholders on agent ecosystem developments

## Prompt Arsenal

| # | Prompt | Use When |
|---|--------|----------|
| 1 | [agent-deployment-readiness-assessment](references/prompts/agent-deployment-readiness-assessment.md) | Starting from zero — need full friction audit, spec, containment, and roadmap |
| 2 | [specification-engineering](references/prompts/specification-engineering.md) | Writing bulletproof agent specs with duality testing |
| 3 | [agent-risk-containment-blueprint](references/prompts/agent-risk-containment-blueprint.md) | Designing isolation, audit trails, and kill switches |
| 4 | [revealed-preference-demand-analyzer](references/prompts/revealed-preference-demand-analyzer.md) | Reading build/install data as market intelligence |
| 5 | [human-agent-collaboration-architecture](references/prompts/human-agent-collaboration-architecture.md) | Designing 70/30 → progressive delegation workflows |
| 6 | [agent-ecosystem-intelligence-briefing](references/prompts/agent-ecosystem-intelligence-briefing.md) | Producing decision-relevant ecosystem briefings |

## Skill Stacking

- **+ Intent Engineering**: Specs define WHAT; intent documents define WHY and HOW. Together = agents with both bulletproof specifications and proper intent architecture
- **+ AI Taste Mastery**: Taste calibration + deployment readiness = humans who evaluate agent output quality while managing deployment architecture. J-curve shortens with better taste
- **+ Nick Saraev (Agentic Workflows)**: Deployment strategy + self-annealing = agents that improve their own specifications based on performance data
- **+ Lance & Yichao (Context Engineering)**: Specification engineering + context window architecture = reduced failure modes at the prompt level

## Key Frameworks

- **5-Phase Deployment Framework**: Friction Audit → Specification Engineering → Containment Architecture → Progressive Delegation → Organizational Readiness
- **Specification Width Principle**: Agent failures trace to spec quality, not AI capability
- **70/30 → 50/50 → 30/70 Progressive Delegation**: Start conservative, expand as trust builds
- **Duality Test**: Best-case vs worst-case scenario analysis for every spec
- **J-Curve Budgeting**: Plan for 2-4 weeks of increasing friction before value
