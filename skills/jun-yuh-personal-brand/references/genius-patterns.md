# Genius Patterns — Jun Yuh Personal Brand

## Pattern 1: The Engineering Deconstruction Method
**Execute**: Import any viral video into CapCut. Break down: scene count, text duration, hook structure, music timing. Measure, don't guess.
**Success Metric**: Can recreate any format from systematic deconstruction

## Pattern 2: The Four Missions Content Architecture (3-1-2-1)
**Execute**: Every post serves ONE mission: Attract (3), Nurture (1), Position (2), Convert (1). Never mix missions.
**Success Metric**: Weekly content calendar shows exact 3-1-2-1 ratio

## Pattern 3: The Silent Film Storytelling Format
**Execute**: Text overlay + B-roll of yourself + emotional music arc + transformation story. No talking head required.
**Success Metric**: 5 elements present in every silent film piece

## Pattern 4: The 7x7 Format Study Protocol
**Execute**: Find 7 creators in your niche. Study 7 videos each. Document what patterns repeat. Import to editing software and measure.
**Success Metric**: 49 videos analyzed before creating your own format

## Pattern 5: Journey vs Expert POV Positioning
**Execute**: If <2 years experience: Journey POV ("learning with you"). If 2+ years: Expert POV ("teaching what I know").

**Execute**: When a post works, create 3-5 derivatives with same format but different angles. Feed algorithm without being flagged.

**Execute**: Text must be readable without pausing. Max 5-7 words per frame. Read out loud to test pacing.

**Execute**: Define: The What (message + pillars), The Who (demographics + psychographics), The Uniqueness (story, skills, experiences)
**Success Metric**: Complete Creative Vision document created before content production

## Pattern 11: The Pivot Bridge Protocol
**Execute**: When changing niches: What you did → Why it matters → What you do now. Connect past to present.
