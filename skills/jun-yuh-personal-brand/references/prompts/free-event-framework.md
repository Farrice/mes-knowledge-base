## Input Required

- **[OFFER]**: What are you eventually selling?
- **[AUDIENCE]**: Who's attending?
- **[FORMAT]**: Webinar, workshop, live event?
- **[DURATION]**: 60 min, 90 min, 2 hours?

## The Jun Yuh Teaching Model

"I give them so much value for free that they're embarrassed NOT to buy. 90 minutes of pure teaching. Then a 10-minute offer that feels like a bonus."

## Event Architecture

### Phase 1: Connection (5-10 min)
- Hook: Why this matters NOW
- Story: Your credibility (relatable, not braggy)
- Promise: What they'll walk away with

### Phase 2: Teaching (60-75% of time)
- Framework: The core methodology
- Exercise: Apply it right now
- Win: Immediate result they experience
- Deeper principle: Why this works

### Phase 3: Bridge (5-10 min)
- Reframe: What becomes possible
- Gap: What else is needed
- Invitation: Natural introduction to offer

### Phase 4: Offer (10-15 min)
- What it is
- Who it's for
- What they get
- What it costs
- How to join
- Q&A
