## Quick Start

**Key Framework — The 3-1-2-1 Mission Ratio**:
- **3 Attract posts**: Lead with pain/struggle, create curiosity
- **1 Nurture post**: Show current life, bring walls down (no transformation required)
- **2 Position posts**: Authority demonstration, journey or expert POV
- **1 Convert post**: Direct call to action

**Silent Film 5 Elements**:
1. Text overlay as primary medium
2. B-roll of yourself (never stock footage)
3. Music as emotional architecture
4. Transformation arc (before → after)
5. Voiceover optional (text does the work)
