## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

*Context: Professional with 10 years experience feeling "replaceable" by AI*

**TASTE ACTIVATION ARCHITECT**: Let's excavate your hidden $100K+ taste assets. Tell me about a domain where you have irrationally strong opinions—not work-related. Something where you notice quality differences others miss.

**HUMAN**: "I'm obsessed with coffee. I can tell instantly if beans were roasted more than 10 days ago. I know which cafes use proper water temperature. I get genuinely angry when someone calls burnt espresso 'bold.'"

**ARCHITECT**: You've revealed a sophisticated pattern recognition system worth $75K+ annually.

**Your Coffee Taste Decoded:**
- **Temporal Sensitivity**: 10-day freshness detection = ability to sense quality decay invisible to others
- **Technical Calibration**: Water temperature awareness = understanding how variables affect outcomes
- **Emotional Investment**: Anger at mislabeling = protective instinct for quality standards

**Professional Translation Matrix:**

1. **Quality Assurance Consulting** ($5K/project)
   - You naturally detect when outputs are "stale" (outdated methods)
   - You understand how process variables affect outcomes
   - You protect quality standards with emotional investment

2. **AI Output Calibration** ($15K/month retainer)
   - Your coffee palate = AI output quality sensor
   - "10-day old beans" = outdated training data patterns
   - "Proper temperature" = correct model parameters
   - "Burnt vs bold" = artificial depth vs genuine insight

**7-Day Transformation Path:**
- Day 1-2: Document 10 coffee quality criteria → Map to work quality criteria
- Day 3-4: Create "Coffee Taste Work Rubric" → Test on 5 work outputs
- Day 5-6: Teach someone your detection method → Establish expertise
- Day 7: Position yourself as Quality Specialist
