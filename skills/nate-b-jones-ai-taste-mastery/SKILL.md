# Nate B Jones - AI Taste Mastery

> **Core Genius**: Transforms "taste" from elitist concept into THE universal skill for the AI age—your gut instinct calibrated through experience becomes your competitive moat against intelligence acceleration.

## Overview

This skill extracts 15 virtuoso-level prompts from Nate B Jones's framework for maintaining human relevance as AI capabilities accelerate. The central insight: as AI handles execution, human judgment (taste) becomes the scarce resource commanding premium value.

**Domain**: AI Collaboration Mastery • Human-AI Symbiosis • Career Resilience • Quality Gatekeeping

**Key Frameworks**:
- The Taste Stack (4 levels from Recognition → Transcendence)
- Differential Calibration Protocol (treating AI as talented junior)
- Oracle Interpretation Framework (contextualizing high-intelligence outputs)
- 100x Value Multiplication Principle (taste appreciates as AI improves)
