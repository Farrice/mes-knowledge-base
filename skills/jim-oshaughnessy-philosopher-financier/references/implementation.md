## 24-Hour Quickstart

| Hour 2-6 | Apply four horsemen audit to one pending decision. Assess one colleague through pre-fall/post-fall lens. Find one faster feedback loop for current project. |
| Hour 6-12 | Document three cross-domain applications of one recent insight. Identify strategic content opportunity for positioning. |
| Hour 12-24 | Draft outline for "book as career catalyst" project. Map your career against four acts framework. Establish daily practice schedule. |
