# Jim O'Shaughnessy - Genius Patterns

17 unconscious mastery behaviors decoded into executable frameworks.

---

## Pattern 1: The Arbitrage of Human Nature
**Execute**: Separate variables into (1) rapidly changing surface dynamics and (2) unchanging human nature constants. Build systems that exploit the constants.
**Success Metric**: Identify 3+ "human nature constants" in any new domain within first analysis session.

---

## Pattern 2: The Encyclopedia Protocol
**Execute**: When entering new territory, consume comprehensively first, then identify which elements "speak to your soul" for deep dive.
**Success Metric**: Complete broad survey before any specialization; identify 5+ unexpected connections.

---

## Pattern 3: Pre-Fall/Post-Fall Assessment
**Execute**: Assess people/ideas: Has this been "punched in the face" by reality? Did they integrate the lesson or double down on prior beliefs?
**Success Metric**: Accurate prediction of how person/idea will handle adversity.

---

## Pattern 4: The Book as Career Catalyst
**Execute**: Write the definitive resource in your domain before you need it. Send to gatekeepers before official release. Use controversy strategically.
**Success Metric**: Book generates 10x+ value in opportunities vs. direct sales revenue.

---

## Pattern 5: Practitioners Over Academics
**Execute**: When consuming theory, immediately ask: "What happens when I actually implement this? What are the real-world constraints?"
**Success Metric**: Zero theories adopted without implementation constraint analysis.

---

## Pattern 6: The Feedback Obsession
**Execute**: Choose domains with immediate, objective feedback. Use feedback to calibrate and improve, not to feel good.
**Success Metric**: Daily feedback capture; weekly pattern analysis; monthly strategy adjustment.

---

## Pattern 7: Many Paths to Heaven
**Execute**: When encountering different approaches, ask: "Is this person's process right FOR THEM given how their mind works?"
**Success Metric**: Successful identification of optimal methodology for others (not just self).

---

## Pattern 8: The Reread Protocol
**Execute**: Identify 5-10 foundational texts. Reread annually. Document what's different—you are the variable, not the text.
**Success Metric**: Documented novel insights from each annual reread.

---

## Pattern 9: The Four Horsemen Defense
**Execute**: Before significant decisions, audit: Am I being driven by fear? Greed? Hope? Am I simply ignorant of something crucial?
**Success Metric**: Pre-decision four horsemen audit documented for all major choices.

---

## Pattern 10: Authenticity Over Polish
**Execute**: For communications meant to connect (not perform), resist editing. Let imperfections stand.
**Success Metric**: Recipients report feeling genuine connection vs. receiving polished artifact.

---

## Pattern 11: The Consensus Reality Check
**Execute**: When evaluating strong consensus, ask: "Is this true, or is this powerful because everyone believes it's true?"
**Success Metric**: Accurate categorization of phenomena as truth-based vs. belief-powered.

---

## Pattern 12: The Synthesis Engine
**Execute**: After learning anything significant, immediately ask: "Where else does this apply that isn't obvious?"
**Success Metric**: 3+ non-obvious applications identified for every significant insight.

---

## Pattern 13: Saturated Intuition Recognition
**Execute**: Track pattern exposure in any domain. Below threshold: use systematic approaches. Above threshold: artistic intuition becomes valid.
**Success Metric**: Accurate self-assessment of which domains allow intuitive vs. systematic judgment.

---

## Pattern 14: The Rebel Integration
**Execute**: Channel rebellious energy into strategic disruption rather than random opposition.
**Success Metric**: Rebellious energy produces structural change, not just noise.

---

## Pattern 15: The Four Acts Architecture
**Execute**: Structure career as sequential acts: Act 1 (Learning), Act 2 (Empire Building), Act 3 (Ecosystem Creation), Act 4 (Legacy/Transmission).
**Success Metric**: Clear act transitions with deliberate capability transfer between acts.

---

## Pattern 16: Money as Information System
**Execute**: Reframe money from objective to information. What is it telling you about value creation?
**Success Metric**: Money decisions made based on information value, not accumulation instinct.

---

## Pattern 17: The Mind-Body Reintegration
**Execute**: When facing persistent physical ailments without clear cause, investigate emotional suppression as potential source.
**Success Metric**: Resolution of unexplained physical symptoms through emotional awareness work.
