# Jim O'Shaughnessy: Philosopher-Financier Skill

## Overview

Jim O'Shaughnessy operates at the intersection of quantitative discipline and humanistic insight—using the classics to decode human nature, then building systematic approaches that "arbitrage" that nature while maintaining intellectual humility about cognitive limitations.

**Core Genius**: Cross-domain synthesis (humanities → finance → media) combined with emotional discipline and systematic pattern recognition across 50+ years.

**Unique Value**: Unlike pure quants who ignore humanity or pure humanists who ignore data, O'Shaughnessy synthesizes both—reading Shakespeare to understand investor psychology, then building systems that protect against the biases literature reveals.

## Quick Start

### 24-Hour Quickstart
1. Read one chapter outside your primary domain
2. Apply four horsemen audit to one pending decision
3. Identify one "human nature constant" in your current work
4. Document three cross-domain applications of one recent insight

### 7-Day Sprint
- **Days 1-2**: Establish reading practice and connection journal
- **Days 3-4**: Apply human nature arbitrage to three challenges
- **Days 5-6**: Draft strategic content positioning plan
- **Day 7**: Create personal operating system document

---

## Core Principles

1. **Human Nature Arbitrage**: Markets change minute-to-minute; human nature barely budges millennia by millennia
2. **Practitioners Over Academics**: Real-world constraints matter more than theoretical elegance
3. **Many Paths to Heaven**: Different methodologies suit different minds
4. **Pre-Fall/Post-Fall**: Trust those who have integrated failure lessons
5. **Four Horsemen Defense**: Guard against fear, greed, hope, and ignorance
6. **Authenticity Over Polish**: Raw connection beats polished artifacts
7. **The Reread Protocol**: Same text + changed reader = new insights
