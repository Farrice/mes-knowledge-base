# Cross-Domain Synthesis - Example Output

## The Reread Principle Synthesis

**Input Insight**: Jim O'Shaughnessy's "reread" practice—reading certain books every year because "you're a different person every year." Same content yields different insights based on evolved context.

**Core Principle**: Periodically revisiting foundational material isn't redundant—YOU have changed. What seemed obvious before becomes profound; what seemed irrelevant becomes crucial.

## Cross-Domain Applications

| Domain | Application |
|--------|-------------|
| **Customer Research** | Re-interview early customers every 12-18 months. Same questions, different answers—they evolved, product evolved, market evolved. |
| **Hiring Assessment** | Re-assess team against original criteria annually. The stretch hire may now be carrying the team; the culture fit may now be a drag. |
| **Strategic Planning** | Revisit original strategic assumptions annually. What you assumed was strength may now seem like liability. |
| **Product Development** | Revisit killed feature ideas annually. Features rejected 18 months ago may now be exactly right. |
| **Relationships** | Reconnect with dormant relationships because YOU changed. The mentor who seemed irrelevant is now exactly relevant. |
| **Content Creation** | Revisit your old content. Your 2-year-old article now seems wrong—that wrongness IS content opportunity. |
