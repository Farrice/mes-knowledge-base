## HORSEMAN DETECTION

| Horseman | Present? | Intensity | Primary Manifestation |
|----------|----------|-----------|----------------------|
| **FEAR** | YES | HIGH | Fear of running out of runway, fear of competition |
| **GREED** | YES | MODERATE | $4M life-changing; desire to lock in guaranteed outcome |
| **HOPE** | YES | MODERATE | Hope continuing leads to larger outcome |
| **IGNORANCE** | YES | MODERATE | Unknown: competitive threat, Series B odds, acquirer intent |

## KEY GUARDRAILS

**Anti-Fear Guardrail**: Get external data on competitive threat before deciding. Talk to 3 customers, 2 investors. Don't let felt fear substitute for assessed risk.

**Anti-Greed Guardrail**: Calculate what $4M actually enables vs. doesn't. Is it "life changed forever" or "nice but still work"?

**Anti-Hope Guardrail**: Write honest bear case. What if growth slows to 8%? What if key competitor raises $50M?

## DECISION PARAMETERS

1. **No decision before ignorance gaps filled.** 2-week timeline is artificial.
2. **No decision in "fear spike" moments.** Decision in scheduled, prepared sessions only.
3. **>40% Series B probability + committed team → Decline**
4. **<20% Series B probability or 2+ key people leaving → Accept**
5. **20-40% → Coin flip; decide on non-financial factors**
