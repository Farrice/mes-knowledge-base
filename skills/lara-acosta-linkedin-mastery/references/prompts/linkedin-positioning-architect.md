*Build Complete Personal Brand Positioning From Zero*

## POSITIONING ARCHITECTURE

### Layer 1: Identity Statement
"I am the [SPECIFIC DESCRIPTOR] who [UNIQUE APPROACH]"
Not generic. Not category. The specific thing you are.

### Layer 2: Elevator Pitch
"I help [WHO] achieve [WHAT] through [HOW] so they can [OUTCOME]"
Clear. Specific. Outcome-focused.

### Layer 3: Social Proof Stack
- Specific numbers (not vague claims)
- Named clients/companies (not "clients")
- Timeline specificity (not "eventually")
- Process transparency (not black-box results)

### Layer 4: Unfair Advantage Map
What do you have that no one else can claim?
- Unique combination of skills
- Specific experience stack
- Access or relationships
- Perspective from journey

### Layer 5: Authority Bio
The 3-5 sentence version that goes everywhere:
LinkedIn headline, about section, speaker bio, everywhere.

### Layer 6: Content Territory
The 3 pillars you'll own:
1. What you DO (core skill)
2. What you BELIEVE (philosophy)
3. What you ENABLE (transformation)
