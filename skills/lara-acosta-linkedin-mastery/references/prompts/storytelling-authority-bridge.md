"I'm done."

Sarah's message hit my phone at 11pm on a Tuesday.

[STORY - Tension moment, specific time]

30 days of daily posting.
Zero clients.
Zero DMs.
Not even her mom was engaging.

"This doesn't work for me. Maybe I'm just not cut out for this."

I asked her one question:
"If someone reads your last 10 posts, what would they hire you for?"

Silence.

Then: "I... I'm not sure."

That was the problem.

[STORY - The diagnosis moment]

Sarah had content. She had consistency. She had discipline.
What she didn't have was positioning.

Nobody knew what she was. Not because she wasn't posting—because she was posting everything.

[LESSON - The insight]

We spent 2 hours rebuilding from scratch:
- One clear identity statement
- Three content pillars
- A bio that made the ask unnecessary

She deleted 80% of her old posts.
Started fresh.

60 days later: $47K in new clients. All inbound.

[STORY - The resolution with specific result]

The lesson that keeps hitting me:
Consistency without clarity is just noise.

Most people who "struggle with content" don't have a content problem.
They have a positioning problem.

[LESSON - Articulated clearly]

If you've been posting and getting silence, stop.
Ask: "What would someone hire me for based on my last 10 posts?"
If you can't answer in one sentence, that's your real problem.

[APPLICATION - Specific action]

What's yours?
Reply with your one-sentence answer. Let's see how clear it is.

[YOUR TURN - Engagement invitation]

**SLAY STRUCTURE ANNOTATION**:
- Lines 1-22: STORY (tension, details, journey)

**AUTHORITY ESTABLISHED**: The story positions the author as someone who diagnoses positioning problems and delivers results ($47K in 60 days). The reader leaves seeing them as the expert.
