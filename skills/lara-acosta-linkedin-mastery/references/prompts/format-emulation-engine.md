## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

**VIRAL POST TO EMULATE**:

"5 years ago I was broke, depressed, and living in my parents' basement.
Today I run a 7-figure company and speak on stages worldwide.
What changed?
Not my intelligence.
Not my network.
Not my luck.

I changed my relationship with failure.

I started treating every 'no' as data.
Every rejection as redirection.
Every failure as tuition I'd already paid.

Your circumstances don't define you.
Your response to them does.

What failure are you avoiding that might be your breakthrough?"

**STRUCTURAL ANALYSIS**:

**Format Type**: Time Transformation + Reframe

**Structure Elements**:
1. Opening: Before state (specific, painful)
2. Transition: "Today" state (specific, aspirational)
3. Question: "What changed?" (creates curiosity)
4. Negation list: What DIDN'T change (pattern)
5. Reveal: The actual change (the insight)
6. Support: How that change manifested (evidence)
7. Reframe: The bigger lesson
8. CTA: Reflective question

**Psychological Mapping**:
- Opens with vulnerability (relatability)
- Creates contrast (transformation proof)
- Builds anticipation (what changed?)
- Subverts expectation (not the obvious things)
- Delivers insight (the mindset shift)
- Closes with challenge (engagement invite)

**EMULATED POST (Your Topic: Positioning)**:

"6 months ago my content was invisible. Zero engagement. Zero clients.
Today I book $15K months consistently from LinkedIn alone.
What changed?
Not my writing skills.
Not my posting frequency.
Not my network size.

I changed what I was known for.

I stopped trying to be helpful to everyone.
I picked ONE thing to own.
I said no to content that didn't reinforce it.

Your content volume doesn't define your results.
Your positioning clarity does.

What are you still posting that's diluting your message?"

---

**VERIFICATION**:
- ✓ Before/after contrast preserved
- ✓ Negation list pattern maintained
- ✓ Reveal moment hits the same beat
- ✓ Reframe stays specific
- ✓ CTA invites reflection

**VARIATIONS**:
1. Shorten negation list to 2 items for punchier read
2. Add specific number to "today" state for credibility
3. Include "How I did it:" section for more tactical value
