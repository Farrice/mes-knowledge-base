Incomplete information demanding resolution.

### Category 2: Controversy/Contrarian
Challenge accepted wisdom.
"Unpopular opinion: Networking events are dead."

### Category 3: Specific Number
Concrete details create credibility.
"127 cold DMs. 0 responses. Then I changed 3 words."

### Category 4: Relatable Pain
Articulate what they feel but can't say.
"You're not lazy. You're burned out on content that goes nowhere."

### Category 5: Story Opening
Narrative pull into specific moment.
"Last Tuesday at 3am, I deleted everything."

### Category 6: Counter-Intuitive Claim
Opposite of expected truth.
"The best content strategy is posting LESS."

### Category 7: Direct Challenge
Confront the reader.
"If your last 10 posts aren't getting engagement, it's not the algorithm."

## FIRST-PRINCIPLE TEST

For each hook, ask:
1. Would this stop someone who doesn't know me?
2. Does this demand to be read further?
3. Is the promise clear without being clickbait?
4. Does this hint at value without giving it away?

**HOOK BANK**:

| Rank | Hook | Category | Test | Notes |
|------|------|----------|------|-------|
| 1 | "Posted every day for 6 months. Zero clients. Changed ONE thing and booked $47K in 30 days." | Specific Number | ✓ | High curiosity + specific result + gap |
| 2 | "Most founders have a content problem. They don't. They have a positioning problem." | Counter-Intuitive | ✓ | Reframe creates immediate intrigue |
| 3 | "Unpopular opinion: Your content isn't bad. You just don't know what you're selling." | Controversy | ✓ | Direct + contrarian + relatable |
| 4 | "I've audited 200+ personal brands. 80% fail for the same reason." | Specific Number | ✓ | Authority + curiosity gap |
| 5 | "The algorithm isn't broken. Your positioning is." | Direct Challenge | ✓ | Confrontational + blame shift |
| 6 | "She had 50 posts. He had 500. She made more money." | Story Opening | ✓ | Paradox creates pull |
| 7 | "Last month I told a client to DELETE 80% of his content. His revenue doubled." | Story Opening | ✓ | Counter-intuitive action + result |
| 8 | "If I were starting over with 0 followers, I wouldn't post for the first 2 weeks." | Counter-Intuitive | ✓ | Challenges "just post" advice |
| 9 | "The question isn't 'what should I post?' It's 'who am I, specifically?'" | Reframe | ✓ | Philosophical shift + recognition |
| 10 | "Most personal branding advice will keep you busy and broke." | Controversy | ✓ | Strong claim + relatable fear |

**FAILED HOOKS** (did not pass first-principle test):

| Hook | Why It Failed |
|------|---------------|
| "Positioning is important" | Too generic, no stopping power |
| "Great content starts with positioning" | No curiosity, sounds like advice |
| "I help people with positioning" | Self-focused, not benefit-focused |
