**PROMOTIONAL POST (LAUNCH)**:

---

I spent 2 years figuring out why some personal brands explode while others flatline.

The difference isn't content.
It's not consistency.
It's not the algorithm.

It's positioning.

When positioning is clear, every post works harder.
When it's fuzzy, even great content fails.

So I built the document I wish I had when I started:

**The 6-Layer Positioning Document**

Fill it in once. Use it forever.
- Your identity statement
- Your elevator pitch
- Your social proof stack
- Your unfair advantage map
- Your authority bio
- Your content pillars

It takes about 1 hour.
It changes everything after.

Drop a 💎 in comments and I'll send it to you.
