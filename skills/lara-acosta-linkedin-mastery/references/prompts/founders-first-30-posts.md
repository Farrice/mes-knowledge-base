### WEEK 1: ESTABLISH WHO YOU ARE

**POST 1** | Story | Pillar 2 (Philosophy) | Day 1

The day I stopped working 80-hour weeks was the day my business tripled.

Not "grew." Tripled.

I know—sounds backwards. Here's what happened:

For 3 years, I wore exhaustion like a badge. Answered emails at midnight. Skipped workouts. Missed dinners. 

My business grew slowly. My health crashed faster.

Then I got forced to stop. Doctor's orders. 3 weeks off.

And everything... worked fine. Actually, better.

That's when I realized: I wasn't leading. I was just busy.

There's a massive difference.

Now I help founders find it before their body forces them to.

What's hustling costing you?

**POST 2** | Educational | Pillar 1 (Methodology) | Day 2

The 3-question meeting filter that saved me 10 hours/week.

Before accepting any meeting, I ask:
1. Does this require synchronous conversation?
2. Am I the only person who can do this?
3. Will this move a priority forward?

If "no" to any → decline or delegate.

That's it. 3 questions.

Result: 40% fewer meetings. Zero dropped balls.

Most meetings exist because someone defaulted to "let's schedule a call" instead of thinking through what they actually need.

Try it for one week. Track what happens.

---

**POST 3** | Opinion | Pillar 2 (Philosophy) | Day 3

Unpopular opinion: "Move fast and break things" is dead.

It worked when you're 23 with nothing to lose.
It doesn't when you have a team, customers, and a reputation.

The founders I coach who scale fastest?
They move deliberately. They think before acting.
They don't mistake chaos for progress.

Speed without direction is just motion.

Calm founders build bigger companies.

Fight me in the comments.

**POST 4** | Story | Pillar 3 (Transformation) | Day 5

Client last month: "I finally took a vacation without my laptop."

First time in 4 years.

When we started working together, she was the bottleneck. Couldn't step away without fires. Her team defaulted to her for everything.

90 days later:
- Team runs without her for weeks at a time
- Revenue increased (not despite the space—because of it)
- She actually remembers why she started the company

This is what real leadership looks like:
Building something that doesn't need you in every meeting.

What would you do with a week truly off?

**POST 5** | Educational | Pillar 1 (Methodology) | Day 7

The 1:1 structure that fixed everything with my team.

Before: 30-minute status updates. Boring. Pointless.
After: 30 minutes of actual coaching. Game-changing.

The structure:
- Mins 0-5: "What's your biggest win this week?"
- Mins 5-15: "What's your biggest challenge right now?"
- Mins 15-25: "What's one decision you need help thinking through?"
- Mins 25-30: "What do you need from me before next time?"

No status updates. That's what Slack is for.

1:1s are for growth, not reporting.

Try it next week. Watch what happens.
