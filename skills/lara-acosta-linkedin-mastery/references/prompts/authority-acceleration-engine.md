## INPUT REQUIRED

- **[CURRENT STATE]**: Starting point (followers, proof, presence)
- **[TARGET POSITIONING]**: What they want to be known for
- **[EXISTING ASSETS]**: Any proof, content, connections they have
- **[TIMELINE]**: How quickly they need to establish authority
- **[CONSTRAINTS]**: Budget, time, reach limitations

## ACCELERATION STRATEGIES

### Strategy 1: Borrowed Authority
Acquire credibility through association.
- Interview experts in your space
- Get quoted by recognized sources
- Partner with established brands
- Reference your network strategically

### Strategy 2: Micro-Proof Stacking
Small wins accumulated = big credibility.
- Document every result (even tiny)
- Screenshot testimonials constantly
- Quantify everything possible
- Share consistently, not once

### Strategy 3: Small Pond Domination
Own a niche before expanding.
- Be THE person for a specific thing
- Win a small audience completely
- Then expand from that base

### Strategy 4: Consistency Signaling
Presence builds trust over time.
- Daily visibility builds memory
- Predictability = reliability
- Missing days = forgotten

### Strategy 5: Authority Content Formats
Certain formats build credibility faster.
- Industry predictions (thought leader signal)
- Frameworks with names (methodology owner)
- Case studies (proof of process)
- Contrarian takes (differentiation)

### Strategy 6: Strategic Visibility
Get seen in the right places.
- Podcast appearances
- Guest posts
- Community leadership
- Speaking opportunities

- Network: 200 LinkedIn connections (not engaged)

### PRIORITY STRATEGIES

**Primary: Micro-Proof Stacking (30 days)**
You have 3 past clients. That's 3 potential testimonials, 3 case studies, 3 referrals. Extract everything before creating content.

**Secondary: Small Pond Domination (60 days)**
Don't try to be "business coach." Be "business coach for creative agency founders" or similar. Own the niche first.

**Tertiary: Borrowed Authority (90 days)**
Podcast interviews accelerate credibility faster than organic content. 10 podcast appearances = 6 months of posting value.
