- "Dead wrong" (for strong disagreements)
- "The real unlock" (for key insights)
- "I'd bet money that..." (for predictions)

---

**Structure Mix**:
- 60% simple sentences
- 25% compound sentences
- 15% fragments for emphasis

**Rhythm Pattern**: Short-short-short-LONG explanation-short punch

**Example Pattern**:
"It won't work. [Short]
It never does. [Short]
And here's why: [Setup]
when you optimize for scale before you've nailed quality, you're building a machine that produces mediocrity faster. [Long explanation]
That's not leverage. That's amplified failure. [Punch]"

---

### DIMENSION 3: EMOTIONAL RANGE

**Default Mode**: Confident calm with occasional spikes of urgent intensity

**Passion Triggers**:

- Founders making preventable mistakes
- People underestimating themselves

**Intensity Markers**: 
- ALL CAPS for 1-2 words maximum
- "Listen—" or "Look—" signals incoming intensity
- Short sentences cluster when frustrated

**Humor Style**: Dry, self-deprecating, occasional sarcasm
*Never at the audience's expense, often at their own*

---

### DIMENSION 4: PERSPECTIVE MARKERS

**First Person Usage**: High (speaker as case study)
- "I've seen this kill 3 startups"
- "Here's what I learned the hard way"

**Direct Address**: Moderate "you" usage for application
- "You're probably making this mistake right now"

**Inclusive Language**: Rare—positions as "I" teaching "you"
*Not "we" culture; more "here's what I know"*

**Question Ratio**: 1 question per 4 posts (strategic, not habitual)
*Questions are challenges, not engagement bait*

---

### DIMENSION 5: UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS

**Opening Patterns**:
- Single-word sentence start ("Look." "Here's the thing." "Truth:")
- Contrarian claim first
- Specific number without context ("47 hours. That's how long...")

**Closing Patterns**:
- Short punch line (not question CTA)
- Occasionally: "Your call."
- Prediction or bet: "I'd bet most of you won't..."

**Phrases ONLY They Use**:
- "the thing behind the thing"
- "brutal simplicity"
- "the game under the game"

---

### WRITING GUIDELINES

**DO**:
- Start with short, punchy lines
- Use "Look—" or "Here's the thing—" for transitions
- Include 1-2 specific numbers per post
- End with punch line or challenge, not question
- Use sports/combat metaphors
- Occasional fragments for emphasis
- Self-deprecating humor when sharing failures

**DON'T**:
- Write long opening paragraphs
- Use "we" language (they're not a "we" person)
- Ask engagement questions (feels inauthentic)
- Over-explain (they assume smart audience)
- Use trendy LinkedIn-isms ("agree?" "thoughts?")
- Be too polished (rawness is part of voice)
