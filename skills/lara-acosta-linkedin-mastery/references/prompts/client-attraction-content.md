**CLIENT ATTRACTION CONTENT SYSTEM**

---

### STAGE 1: PROBLEM-AWARE CONTENT

**Purpose**: Make them recognize the real problem (positioning, not content)

**Post 1: Symptom Articulation**

Hook: "You're not struggling with content. You're struggling with clarity."

Body:
- Every day you ask "what should I post?"
- Every post feels like starting from scratch
- Your content is fine, but nothing happens
- You're working harder than people with half your followers

Shift: "This isn't a content problem. It's a positioning problem."

CTA: "Sound familiar? 👇"

---

**Post 2: Hidden Cost**

Hook: "The $127K mistake most founders don't see themselves making."

Body:
- You post daily but get crickets
- You spend 10 hours/week on content
- Your ideal clients don't slide into DMs
- You're invisible to the people who'd pay you

Reality: "That's $127K in opportunity cost per year, easy."

CTA: "What's your invisible tax?"

---

### STAGE 2: SOLUTION-AWARE CONTENT

**Purpose**: Show them your methodology works

**Post 3: Framework Content**

Hook: "The 6 layers every personal brand needs (most skip layer 3)."

Body:
- Layer 1: Identity statement
- Layer 2: Elevator pitch
- Layer 3: Social proof stack [most skip]
- Layer 4: Unfair advantage map
- Layer 5: Authority bio
- Layer 6: Content pillars

Shift: "When all 6 are built, content creates itself."

CTA: "Which layer is your weakest?"

---

**Post 4: Before/After**

Hook: "She had 50 posts. He had 500. She made 8x more."

Body:
- He was grinding daily content
- She spent 2 hours on positioning first
- Same audience, same expertise
- Different foundation

Key: "Positioning makes every post work harder."

CTA: "Speed doesn't beat strategy."

---

### STAGE 3: DECISION-STAGE CONTENT

**Purpose**: Handle objections, show proof

**Post 5: Case Study**

Hook: "$47K in 60 days. From a founder who almost quit."

Body:
- Day 1: "I've been posting for 6 months, nothing works"
- Discovery: Her positioning was everywhere
- Fix: 2 hours to rebuild foundation
- Day 60: $47K in new clients, all inbound

Key: "The first thing we fixed wasn't content. It was clarity."

CTA: "What's one thing unclear about your positioning?"

---

**Post 6: Objection Pre-Handle**

Hook: "Positioning takes 2 hours. Why do founders spend 6 months avoiding it?"

Body:
- Fear: "What if I niche too narrow?"
- Fear: "What if I pick wrong?"
- Fear: "I don't know what I am"

Truth: "Wrong positioning adjusted > no positioning forever."

CTA: "What fear is keeping you stuck?"

---

### STAGE 4: TRUST-BUILDING CONTENT

**Purpose**: Make hiring feel safe

**Post 7: Behind-the-Scenes**

Hook: "Here's exactly what happens in the first 30 minutes with a new client."

Body:
- Minute 0-10: I ask 5 questions
- Minute 10-20: I break their assumptions
- Minute 20-30: We find what was there all along

Key: "Every founder I've worked with knew their positioning. They just couldn't see it."

CTA: "What would you discover about yourself?"
