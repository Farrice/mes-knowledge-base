# Boris Claude Code

> Creator-level insights from Boris, the creator of Claude Code and co-creator of Claude Cowork at Anthropic.

## Overview

Transform from AI user to AI workforce commander. Boris's methodology treats AI agents as employees to be orchestrated, not tools to be operated. This skill enables 10x productivity through parallel agent management, plan-first execution, and self-verifying workflows.

**Core Philosophy**: "The compound interest of productivity isn't doing more things—it's doing the same things with increasing leverage through AI orchestration."

## When to Use This Skill

- **Multi-instance Work**: Running parallel AI agents on different workstreams
- **Plan-First Execution**: Guaranteeing first-attempt success on complex tasks
- **Cross-Device Workflows**: Mobile → Desktop → Web continuity
- **Knowledge Systems**: Building CLAUDE.md files that compound advantage
- **Team Enablement**: Training others on AI productivity systems

## Core Frameworks

### 1. The AI Operations Manager Mindset
You're not a user of AI—you're a manager of AI employees:
- **Assign tasks**, don't perform them
- **Review output**, don't create it
- **Orchestrate workflows**, don't execute steps

### 2. Plan-First Execution
Every complex task gets a plan BEFORE execution:
1. Claude drafts plan
2. User reviews and approves
3. Claude executes with confidence

**Result**: First-attempt success rate goes from ~60% to ~95%

### 3. The CLAUDE.md Compounding System
Your knowledge base is a competitive moat:
- Every project adds context
- Every success adds patterns
- Every failure adds guardrails

### 4. Multi-Instance Orchestration
Parallel agents multiply output:
- **Primary instance**: Main work
- **Research instance**: Background research
- **Review instance**: QA and verification
- **Specialist instances**: Domain-specific tasks

### 5. Self-Verification Loop
Never trust single-pass output:
```
Generate → Verify → Improve → Ship
```

## Quick Start

1. **Hour 1**: Deploy `plan-first-execution` on your next complex task
2. **Hour 2**: Create your first `CLAUDE.md` using `knowledge-base-compounding`
3. **Day 1**: Try running 2 parallel instances on different streams
4. **Week 1**: Establish daily orchestration rhythm

## Integration Points

- **Pairs with**: Darrel Wilson (automation), Andrew Wilkinson (vibe coding)
- **Upstream from**: Any productivity workflow, team training
- **Works in**: Claude Code, Claude Cowork, Claude Pro
