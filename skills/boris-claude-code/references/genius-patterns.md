# Boris Claude Code — Genius Patterns

## Pattern Inventory (12 Decoded)

### Pattern 1: Manager, Not User (Identity Shift)
**Observable Behavior**: Boris doesn't "use" Claude—he assigns tasks to Claude as if delegating to an employee.

**Executable Behavior**: When approaching any task, ask "What would I delegate?" not "What should I do?"

**Success Metric**: Zero tasks you personally execute that Claude could do

---

### Pattern 2: Plan-Before-Execute (Failure Prevention)
**Observable Behavior**: Complex tasks always get a plan drafted BEFORE any execution

**Executable Behavior**: For any task >5 steps: "First give me a plan, then wait for approval before executing"

**Success Metric**: First-attempt success rate >90%

---

### Pattern 3: CLAUDE.md as Living Brain (Context Compounding)
**Observable Behavior**: Boris maintains a CLAUDE.md that grows with every project

**Executable Behavior**: After every significant project, add learnings to CLAUDE.md

**Success Metric**: CLAUDE.md doubles in value every quarter

---

### Pattern 4: Multi-Instance Parallel Processing
**Observable Behavior**: Boris runs 5-10 instances simultaneously on different workstreams

**Executable Behavior**: Spawn specialized instances for research, execution, review

**Success Metric**: 3-5x throughput increase on complex projects

---

### Pattern 5: Self-Verification Loop (Error Elimination)
**Observable Behavior**: Never trusts single-pass output—always has Claude verify its own work

**Executable Behavior**: Add "Now verify this output against the original requirements" to workflow

**Success Metric**: Error rate drops by 80%+

---

### Pattern 6: Device-Ubiquitous Capture (Dead Time Recovery)
**Observable Behavior**: Uses mobile to capture and start work that desktop will complete

**Executable Behavior**: Any idle time (commute, waiting) becomes capture/start time

**Success Metric**: 2x productive hours per day

---

### Pattern 7: Context Persistence Protocol
**Observable Behavior**: Long-running contexts preserved across sessions via clear handoff

**Executable Behavior**: End sessions with "Summarize state for next session continuation"

**Success Metric**: Zero context loss between sessions

---

### Pattern 8: Command Center Architecture
**Observable Behavior**: CLAUDE.md serves as command center for all agent activity

**Executable Behavior**: Central file references all active projects, contexts, and preferences

**Success Metric**: Any new Claude session immediately productive

---

### Pattern 9: Exponential Integration Rhythm
**Observable Behavior**: Systematically evaluates and integrates new AI capabilities

**Executable Behavior**: Monthly capability audit: "What new can I do that I couldn't before?"

**Success Metric**: Capability compounds month-over-month

---

### Pattern 10: Teaching Through Prompts
**Observable Behavior**: Converts successful workflows into reusable prompts

**Executable Behavior**: After any workflow >3 uses, convert to deployable prompt

**Success Metric**: Prompt library grows from actual usage

---

### Pattern 11: Intentional Friction Reduction
**Observable Behavior**: Continuously removes steps between thought and execution

**Executable Behavior**: Audit: "What step could I eliminate between intention and result?"

**Success Metric**: Time-to-execution shrinks continuously

---

### Pattern 12: Strategic Pause Points
**Observable Behavior**: Knows when to pause for human judgment vs. let AI run

**Executable Behavior**: Define explicit checkpoints for high-stakes decisions

**Success Metric**: Optimal balance of speed and control

---

## Hidden Knowledge Points (7)

1. **Multiple tabs = Multiple employees** — Each Claude tab is a specialist

2. **Phone starts, computer finishes** — Mobile for capture, desktop for execution

3. **Plan approval is the leverage point** — 30 seconds of review saves 30 minutes of rework

4. **CLAUDE.md is your moat** — The longer you build it, the more valuable it becomes

5. **Parallel execution changes everything** — 5 instances = 5x throughput

6. **Verification costs less than errors** — Always add the review step

7. **Context handoffs must be explicit** — Never assume Claude remembers
