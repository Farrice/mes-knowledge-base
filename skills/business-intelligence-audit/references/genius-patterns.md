## Pattern 1: 7-Step Problem Solving

The core McKinsey methodology. Apply this to structure any audit:

1. **Define the problem** → What is the central question?
2. **Structure the problem** → Break into key components (MECE)
3. **Prioritize issues** → Focus on highest-impact areas
4. **Develop work plan** → What data to gather, in what order
5. **Conduct analyses** → Extract and examine evidence
6. **Synthesize findings** → What does the data tell us?
7. **Develop recommendations** → Actionable, prioritized next steps

## Pattern 2: MECE Principle

**M**utually **E**xclusive, **C**ollectively **E**xhaustive

Every analysis should:
- **Mutually Exclusive:** No overlapping categories (no double-counting)
- **Collectively Exhaustive:** All possibilities covered (nothing missed)

**Application:** When breaking down a business, use MECE categories:
- Product / Market / Operations / Finance
- Awareness / Consideration / Conversion / Retention
- Strategy / Structure / Systems / Skills / Staff / Style / Shared Values (7S)

## Pattern 3: McKinsey 7S Framework

Analyze organizational alignment across 7 elements:

| Element | Type | Questions |
|---------|------|-----------|
| **Strategy** | Hard | What's their stated competitive approach? |
| **Structure** | Hard | How is the business organized? (visible org structure) |
| **Systems** | Hard | What processes/tools do they use? (visible tech stack) |
| **Shared Values** | Soft | What do they claim to believe? (mission, values) |
| **Skills** | Soft | What capabilities do they highlight? |
| **Style** | Soft | How do they communicate? (brand voice, culture signals) |
| **Staff** | Soft | Who works there? (team page, LinkedIn) |

**For web-based audits:** Focus on visible elements (Strategy, Systems, Shared Values, Skills, Style). Staff/Structure may require LinkedIn research.

## Pattern 4: Pyramid Principle

Structure all deliverables top-down:

```
MAIN INSIGHT (The "So What")
├── Supporting Point 1
│   ├── Evidence A
│   └── Evidence B
├── Supporting Point 2
│   ├── Evidence C
│   └── Evidence D
└── Supporting Point 3
    ├── Evidence E
    └── Evidence F
```

**Rules:**
- Lead with the answer, not the analysis
- Group supporting ideas logically (max 3-5 per level)
- Each level answers "Why?" or "How?" for the level above

---

## Pattern 5: Issue Trees

Break complex problems into component parts:

```
"Why is revenue declining?"
├── Volume problem?
│   ├── Fewer new customers?
│   └── Higher churn?
└── Price problem?
    ├── Discounting more?
    └── Product mix shift?
```

**Application:** For any business gap you identify, build an issue tree to find root cause.

---

## Pattern 6: Hypothesis-Driven Approach

Don't boil the ocean. Start with hypotheses:

1. **Form hypothesis** → "I believe their main issue is X because..."
2. **Identify data needed** → "To prove/disprove, I need to see..."
3. **Gather evidence** → Extract specific information
4. **Refine or pivot** → Update hypothesis based on findings

**Speed advantage:** This turns a 10-hour audit into a 2-hour audit.

## Pattern 7: Four Horsemen Audit

Scan for cognitive biases in the business's decision-making:

| Horseman | Signs | Risk |
|----------|-------|------|
| **Fear** | Defensive messaging, playing not to lose | Missing opportunities |
| **Greed** | Over-promising, too many products | Brand dilution |
| **Hope** | No evidence for claims, wishful thinking | Credibility gap |
| **Ignorance** | Outdated positioning, missing trends | Competitive blindness |

---

## Pattern 8: Pre-Fall / Post-Fall Assessment

Determine business maturity:

| Stage | Characteristics | Needs |
|-------|-----------------|-------|
| **Pre-Fall** | Overconfident, untested, "we have it figured out" | Humility injection, stress tests |
| **Post-Fall** | Humbled, learned hard lessons, open to help | Systematic improvement, leverage |

**Post-Fall businesses** are better consulting clients—they've been humbled and are open to outside perspectives.

---

## Pattern 9: XYZ Competitive Frame

Position findings relative to competition:

> "They do X, but competitors do Y, which means the opportunity is Z."

Example:
> "They use testimonials (X), but top competitors use detailed case studies with metrics (Y), which means there's a credibility gap in their social proof (Z)."

---

## Pattern 10: The "So What" Test

For every finding, ask: **"So what?"**

- If you can't answer it → finding is not actionable
- If the answer is obvious → finding is not insightful
- If the answer is surprising AND actionable → INCLUDE IT

**Quality filter:** Only include insights that pass this test.
