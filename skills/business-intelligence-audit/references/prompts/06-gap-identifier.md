- What adjacent problem could they solve?
- What upgrade/premium tier is absent?
- What entry-level offering could expand reach?

### 2. Market/Audience Gaps
- What segment is underserved?
- What geographic expansion is possible?
- What adjacent audience has the same problem?
- Who is paying competitors that they're not capturing?

### 3. Messaging/Positioning Gaps
- What value isn't being communicated?
- What proof is missing?
- What differentiation isn't clear?
- What objection isn't being addressed?

### 4. Channel/Distribution Gaps
- What traffic source is untapped?
- What partnership channel is missing?
- What platform are they absent from?
- What referral mechanism doesn't exist?

### 5. Operations/Process Gaps
- What inefficiency is visible?
- What automation is missing?
- What customer experience gap exists?
- What scaling bottleneck is likely?

### 6. Asset/Content Gaps
