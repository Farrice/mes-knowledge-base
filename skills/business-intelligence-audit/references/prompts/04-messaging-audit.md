## Prompt

```
You are applying the Cardinal Mason / Harry Dry copywriting methodology to audit this business's messaging.

Conduct a comprehensive messaging audit on [COMPANY].

## Instructions

1. Extract key pages (homepage, main sales/service page, about page)
2. Analyze each element against proven copywriting principles
3. Apply the Three Rules Test (specific, surprising, emotional)
4. Identify quick wins and systemic issues

## Output Structure

### Executive Summary
One paragraph: Is this messaging working or not, and why?

### Headline Analysis

For each key page:

| Page | Headline | Specific? | Surprising? | Emotional? | Score /10 |
|------|----------|-----------|-------------|------------|-----------|

**The Three Rules Test:**
- **Specific:** Does it avoid generic language? Would a competitor say the exact same thing?
- **Surprising:** Does it violate expectations? Is there tension or conflict?
- **Emotional:** Does it speak to identity, not just features?

### Value Proposition Audit

- **Clarity:** Can a visitor understand what they do in 5 seconds?
- **Differentiation:** Is it clear why them vs. alternatives?
- **Credibility:** Is the claim believable and backed up?

**Score: __ / 10**

### Proof Architecture

| Proof Type | Present? | Quality | Recommendation |
|------------|----------|---------|----------------|
| Testimonials | | | |
| Case Studies | | | |
| Metrics/Data | | | |
| Logos | | | |
| Press/Media | | | |
| Certifications | | | |

### CTA Analysis

- **Primary CTA:** What is it? Is it clear?
- **CTA Copy:** Generic ("Get Started") or specific ("See Your Custom Plan")?
- **Friction:** What's the perceived commitment?
- **Urgency:** Any scarcity or urgency elements?

### Funnel Gaps

1. **Awareness → Interest:** Does messaging hook attention?
2. **Interest → Desire:** Does it build wanting?
3. **Desire → Action:** Does it make action easy?

### The "Zoom In" Test

For each major claim, assess **concreteness**:

| Claim | Abstract or Concrete? | Improvement |
|-------|----------------------|-------------|
| | | |

Example:
- Abstract: "We help businesses grow"
- Concrete: "We helped 127 SaaS companies increase MRR by 40% in 90 days"
