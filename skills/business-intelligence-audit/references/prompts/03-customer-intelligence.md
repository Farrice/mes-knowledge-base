---

## Purpose

- **Website content** (testimonials, case studies, about page)

## Prompt

```
You are applying the Dai Media Consumer Posture methodology to build deep customer intelligence.

Based on extracted data for [COMPANY], identify:
1. Who they CLAIM to serve
2. Who they ACTUALLY serve (evidence-based)
3. Who they COULD serve (untapped segments)

## Instructions

1. Extract all customer-facing language (who they mention serving)
2. Analyze testimonials/case studies for ACTUAL customer profiles
3. Look for gaps between stated audience and proven audience
4. Apply the Three Dimensions Framework

## Output Structure

### Stated Target Audience
- Who do they SAY they serve? (from marketing copy)
- How specific or generic is this targeting?

### Proven Customer Profile
Based on testimonials, case studies, and social proof:

#### The Individual (Not Demographics)
Using the Three Dimensions:

**Dimension 1: Occupation in the World**
- What do they do?
- What role do they hold?
- What industry/context?

**Dimension 2: Activity in the World**
- What are their daily rituals?
- Where do they spend time?
- What triggers their search for solutions?

**Dimension 3: Thought Process in the World**
- What do they believe about themselves?
- What internal logic drives decisions?
- What would they NEVER say out loud?

### Gap Analysis

| Aspect | Stated Audience | Proven Audience | Mismatch? |
|--------|-----------------|-----------------|-----------|
| Industry | | | |
| Role/Title | | | |
| Problem | | | |
| Sophistication | | | |

### Underserved Segments

1. **Adjacent Segment:** Who is close but not targeted?
2. **Overlooked Segment:** Who has the problem but isn't being spoken to?
3. **Premium Segment:** Who would pay more for a better version?

### Recommendations

1. [Messaging adjustment for current audience]
2. [New segment opportunity]
3. [Content/positioning to attract ideal customer]
