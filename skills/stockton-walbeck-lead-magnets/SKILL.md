# Stockton Walbeck — Lead Magnet Mastery

> Invoke with: `@stockton-walbeck` or lead magnet / lead gen / opt-in strategy requests

## Overview

Stockton Walbeck's framework reduces all lead magnets to **4 types** (Clarifier, Sampler, Starter, Shortcut) and scores them against a **5-rule scorecard** that predicts revenue potential. The critical insight: Rule 5 (obvious next step to your paid offer) is the only rule that determines profitability — you can ace the other four and still make zero money.

Built from 100+ real lead magnets, 1.5M+ emails captured, and $25M in analyzed revenue.

## Prompt Arsenal

| Prompt | File | Use Case |
|--------|------|----------|
| Lead Magnet Type Selector | `references/prompts/lead-magnet-type-selector.md` | Diagnose audience state → prescribe the correct lead magnet type |
| Lead Magnet 5-Rule Audit | `references/prompts/lead-magnet-5-rule-audit.md` | Score any lead magnet against the 5-rule scorecard, find the profit gap |
| Lead Magnet-to-Offer Bridge | `references/prompts/lead-magnet-offer-bridge.md` | Reverse-engineer the connection between a lead magnet and a paid offer |
| Lead Magnet Idea Generator | `references/prompts/lead-magnet-idea-generator.md` | Generate scored lead magnet ideas across all 4 types with a launch sequence |
| Multi-Touch Funnel Architect | `references/prompts/lead-magnet-funnel-architect.md` | Design full-funnel lead magnet sequences that compound trust |

## Quick Start

1. **Don't know what type to build?** → Run `lead-magnet-type-selector`
2. **Have a lead magnet already?** → Run `lead-magnet-5-rule-audit`
3. **Lead magnet isn't converting to sales?** → Run `lead-magnet-offer-bridge` (it's probably a Rule 5 failure)
4. **Need a bunch of ideas?** → Run `lead-magnet-idea-generator`
5. **Want a full-funnel system?** → Run `lead-magnet-funnel-architect`

## Key Frameworks

### The 4-Type Taxonomy
| Type | Function | When to Use |
|------|----------|-------------|
| **Clarifier** | Reveals a problem or gap | Audience doesn't know they have a problem |
| **Sampler** | Gives a taste of the paid offer | Audience is skeptical you can help |
| **Starter** | Provides the first doable step | Audience is overwhelmed and paralyzed |
| **Shortcut** | Ready-made tool that skips work | Audience knows what to do but lacks time |

### The 5-Rule Scorecard
1. **One Person, One Promise** — Laser-focused on one specific person with one specific outcome
2. **Clear in One Line** — Explainable in 10 seconds
3. **Fast Win** — Value felt in 1-15 minutes
4. **Asymmetric Value** — Massive value, minimal ongoing effort
5. **Obvious Next Step** — Creates the problem your paid offer solves *(the profitability gate)*

## Integration Notes

- Pairs with **@cardinal-mason** for conversion copy on lead magnet landing pages
- Pairs with **@tobias-allen** for email sequences post-opt-in
- Pairs with **@samuel-thompson** for product-market fit validation before building
- Pairs with **@lara-acosta** for LinkedIn-specific lead magnet distribution
