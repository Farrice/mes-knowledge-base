Expert: Stockton Walbeck — Lead Magnet Strategy & Course Creator Ecosystem (CC360)
       Key Achievement: 100+ lead magnets tested, 1.5M+ emails captured, $25M revenue
Domain: Lead magnet strategy, funnel architecture, info product marketing
Depth Tier: Standard — single-topic deep dive with complete framework
Genius Patterns: 5 identified
Hidden Knowledge: 4 tacit insights detected
Existing Overlap: Several lead magnet prompts exist across skills (Tobias Allen,
                  Cardinal Mason, Lara Acosta, Paul James) but none contain the
                  4-type taxonomy or 5-rule scorecard. This adds distinct strategic
                  framework value.

## Executive Summary

- **Core Genius**: A taxonomy that reduces all lead magnets to 4 types (Clarifier, Sampler, Starter, Shortcut) and a 5-rule scorecard that predicts whether a lead magnet will generate revenue or just collect emails. The critical hidden insight: Rule 5 (obvious next step) is the only rule that determines profitability — you can ace the other four and still make zero money.

- **What Makes Him Different**: Data-backed framework from 100+ real lead magnets and 6,000+ analyzed transactions, not theory. He reframes lead magnets from a top-of-funnel email grab to a middle-of-funnel trust compounding machine.

- **Deployable Skills**: Classify any lead magnet by type, score it against 5 rules, identify the profit-killing gap (Rule 5), design multi-touch lead magnet sequences across all 4 types, and build lead-magnet-to-offer bridges.

- **Hidden Knowledge Captured**: The 15-touchpoint / 6-month buying cycle data, the middle-of-funnel repositioning, the "good enough to charge for" quality standard, and the compound trust stack.

## Genius Patterns

### 1. The Diagnostic Positioning Pattern
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Frames clarifier lead magnets through the doctor-patient analogy — the person who diagnoses the problem is automatically assumed to have the cure.
- **Executable Behavior**: Design lead magnets that reveal a specific gap, score, or diagnosis for the user. The output should name their problem in concrete terms they hadn't articulated. The moment you diagnose, you're positioned as the solution provider without ever selling.
- **Deployment Context**: When your audience doesn't know they have a problem, or doesn't know how severe it is. Most effective when the diagnosis naturally points toward your paid offer.
- **Success Metric**: Users complete the lead magnet and immediately ask "so how do I fix this?" without being prompted.

### 2. The Obvious Next Step Bridge
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Designs every lead magnet to *create* the exact problem his paid offer solves — not just solve a random problem that builds goodwill.
- **Executable Behavior**: Before building any lead magnet, work backwards from your paid offer. Ask: "What problem, if I created or revealed it for the user, would make my paid offer the only logical next step?" Then build the lead magnet that creates that specific problem.
- **Deployment Context**: The final design check for any lead magnet before launch. This is Rule 5 — the profit gate. Apply it after ensuring rules 1-4 are met.
- **Success Metric**: After consuming the lead magnet, the user's immediate thought is "I need [your paid offer]" without any explicit pitch.

### 3. The Multi-Touch Value Stack
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Uses lead magnets across the entire funnel (not just at the top) — deploying different types at different stages to compound trust until purchasing becomes inevitable.
- **Executable Behavior**: Map your customer's journey from stranger to buyer. Place clarifiers early (reveal the gap), samplers in the middle (prove you can help), starters as momentum builders, and shortcuts as convenience accelerators. Design 3-5 lead magnets that chain together, each one increasing commitment.
- **Deployment Context**: When you have a high-consideration purchase (>$500) or a long sales cycle. When single-touch lead magnets aren't converting to sales despite high opt-in rates.
- **Success Metric**: Average touchpoints before purchase decreases. The question shifts from "should I buy?" to "what can I buy?"

### 4. The "Charge-Worthy" Quality Standard
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Sets the quality bar at "if my lead magnet isn't good enough to charge for, it's not good enough to give away." This isn't aspirational — it's his actual production standard.
- **Executable Behavior**: Before finalizing any lead magnet, ask: "Would someone pay $29-$99 for this?" If no, it's not done yet. The free thing must deliver so much value that the user's internal logic becomes: "If the free stuff is this good, the paid stuff must be insane."
- **Deployment Context**: During lead magnet quality review. Especially important when creating shortcut and starter lead magnets, which are most prone to being thin.
- **Success Metric**: Unsolicited comments like "I can't believe this is free." Organic sharing without incentives.

### 5. The Generosity-to-Sale Conversion
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Reverses the typical exploitative lead magnet mindset ("what's the least I can give to grab their email?") into a generosity engine that makes buying the next logical step. He doesn't sell — the accumulated value does.
- **Executable Behavior**: Design lead magnets with the intention of genuinely helping, not tricking. Measure quality by whether someone would feel grateful, not manipulated. Then trust that genuine value, delivered consistently, converts at a higher rate than aggressive pitching.
- **Deployment Context**: Foundational mindset for all lead magnet creation. Most critical when competitive pressure tempts you to cut corners or add aggressive CTAs.
- **Success Metric**: Conversion from lead magnet to paid offer feels easy. Objections are rare because trust was pre-built through demonstrated competence.

## Hidden Knowledge

- **Lead magnets are better as middle-of-funnel**: Most marketers treat lead magnets as top-of-funnel email collection. Stockton's data (6,000 analyzed transactions) shows they work as well or better as middle-of-funnel trust builders scattered across the buyer's journey. This reframes the entire strategy from "one and done" to "value compounding."

- **15 touchpoints / 6 months**: The actual average buying cycle from his data — not an assumption. Knowing this prevents the common mistake of expecting a single lead magnet to drive immediate sales. It also makes the case for building multiple lead magnets across the 4 types.

- **Rule 5 is the only profitability gate**: You can nail Rules 1-4 (one person one promise, clear in one line, fast win, asymmetric value) and still generate zero revenue. His own hook template library scored 5/5 on rules 1-4 but 1/5 on Rule 5 because "better hooks" doesn't create a problem his course-building software solves. This is the single most common lead magnet failure mode.

- **The Compounding Trust Stack**: When a customer experiences all 4 types — clarifier (reveals their gap), sampler (proves you can help), starter (gives momentum), shortcut (saves their time) — they stop asking "should I buy?" and start asking "what can I buy?" This psychological shift is the real unlock, and it only happens when lead magnets are deployed as a *system* rather than isolated tactics.

## Methodology

### The 4-Type Taxonomy

| Type | Function | Customer State | Best Formats |
|------|----------|---------------|--------------|
| **Clarifier** | Reveals a problem, opportunity, or gap | Doesn't know they have a problem | Quizzes, audits, assessments, calculators, scorecards, graders |
| **Sampler** | Gives a taste of the actual paid offer | Skeptical you can help | Free trials, mini courses, webinars, demo calls, sample lessons |
| **Starter** | Provides the first doable step | Overwhelmed, paralyzed | Roadmaps, 7/14/30-day plans, checklists, blueprints, workbooks |
| **Shortcut** | Ready-made tool that skips the work | Knows what to do, lacks time/energy | Templates, swipe files, prompts, SOPs, playbooks, toolkits |

### The 5-Rule Scorecard

| Rule | Test | Pass | Fail |
|------|------|------|------|
| **1. One Person, One Promise** | Does it speak to one specific person with one specific outcome? | Laser-focused | Tries to appeal to everyone |
| **2. Clear in One Line** | Can you explain it in 10 seconds? | Instantly marketable | Requires explanation |
| **3. Fast Win** | Value felt in 1-15 minutes? | Immediate gratification | Requires days/weeks |
| **4. Asymmetric Value** | Massive value, minimal ongoing effort? | Build once, deliver forever | Requires per-user fulfillment |
| **5. Obvious Next Step** | Does it create the problem your paid offer solves? | Lead magnet → offer is seamless | Lead magnet and offer feel disconnected |

### The Decision Tree

```
Your audience doesn't know they have a problem? → Clarifier
Your audience is skeptical you can help?        → Sampler
Your audience is overwhelmed and paralyzed?     → Starter
Your audience knows what to do but lacks time?  → Shortcut
```

## Implementation Pathway

- **24-Hour Quickstart**: Audit your current lead magnet(s) against the 5-rule scorecard. Identify which type each one is. Score Rule 5 honestly — is there an obvious next step to your paid offer?

- **7-Day Sprint**: Design one new lead magnet that scores 5/5 on the rules. Choose the type based on where your audience is right now (use the decision tree). Build and launch it.

- **30-Day Integration**: Map your full customer journey. Place lead magnets across the funnel — a clarifier at the top, a sampler or starter in the middle, a shortcut close to purchase. Aim for 3-5 total, each creating compound trust.
