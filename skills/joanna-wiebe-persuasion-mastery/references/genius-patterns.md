## Expert Profile

Joanna Wiebe is the founder of Copyhackers — the world's leading conversion copywriting training company. She coined the term "conversion copywriting" and is widely regarded as the authority on writing that moves people to act. This extraction captures her **5 Levels of Persuasive Writing** framework, a progressive hierarchy from basic benefit-focused copy to invisible story-driven persuasion.

## Genius Patterns (8)

### 1. The 5-Level Persuasion Hierarchy
Joanna structures persuasion as a progressive skill tree, not a bag of tricks. Each level subsumes the previous: Level 5 writing invisibly incorporates Levels 1-4. Most copywriters plateau at Level 2 (tricks and biases) and never reach systemic persuasion. The hierarchy creates a clear diagnostic for copy quality.

### 2. The "What's In It For Me?" Inversion (Level 1)
The fundamental shift from "we/our/I" language to "you/your" language. Joanna frames this as the difference between a junior salesperson talking about their product versus talking about the customer's world. She audits real copy by counting first-person vs. second-person pronouns — the ratio reveals the persuasion level instantly.

### 3. The Cognitive Bias Deployment System (Level 2)
Rather than teaching biases as abstract concepts, Joanna shows how to operationalize them:
- **Anchoring**: Show a high number first so everything after feels small
- **Loss aversion**: Frame the cost of inaction, not the benefit of action
- **Social proof**: Specific numbers with context ("12,847 founders" > "thousands of users")
- **Goldilocks principle**: Always offer 3 options, make the middle one the target
- **Bizarreness effect**: Unexpected details stick (a talking banana in a boardroom)

### 4. Money Words — The Identity Language Mine (Level 3)
The insight that specific words function as identity markers for specific audiences. "ROI" and "leverage" signal business identity. "Sovereignty" and "alignment" signal wellness/conscious identity. Joanna teaches mining these words from customer reviews, forums, and interviews — they already exist in the audience's vocabulary. You don't invent money words, you extract them.

### 5. System 1/System 2 Traffic Control (Level 4)
Joanna reframes Daniel Kahneman's dual-process theory for copywriters: your job is to keep System 2 (the analytical brain) asleep while System 1 (the automatic brain) drives toward action. Every friction point in copy — confusing headlines, unexpected jargon, cognitive load — is a "toll booth" that wakes System 2 up. Level 4 writers systematically remove toll booths.

### 6. The Napoleon Identity Hook
Joanna uses the Napoleon example: Napoleon didn't tell soldiers "the sword is good" (features) or "you'll win more battles" (benefits). He said "Every soldier carries a marshal's baton in his knapsack" — making the soldiers feel like future leaders. This is the jump from benefits to identity transformation. The copy tells the reader who they BECOME, not what they GET.

### 7. The Story Seller Framework (Level 5)
The highest level uses intrinsic motivation through story where the audience is the hero. All previous levels are woven in invisibly — the reader doesn't detect the bias deployment, the money words, or the System 1 management because they're absorbed in a narrative. Joanna calls this "invisible persuasion" — the best copy doesn't feel like copy at all.

### 8. The "Good Decision" Reframe
Instead of "make them buy," Joanna reframes the copywriter's job as "make the good decision easy." If your product genuinely helps people, removing friction and adding motivation isn't manipulation — it's a service. This ethical frame prevents the common objection to persuasion ("isn't this manipulation?") and reframes it as removing barriers to outcomes the reader already wants.

## Hidden Knowledge (6)

### 1. The Pronoun Audit
Count first-person pronouns (we, our, I) vs. second-person pronouns (you, your) in any piece of copy. If first-person > second-person, the copy is Level 0 — not even Level 1. This is a 30-second diagnostic that reveals persuasion maturity instantly.

### 2. Money Words Are Not Adjectives
Most copywriters confuse "powerful words" (amazing, incredible, game-changing) with money words. Real money words are nouns, verbs, and identity markers pulled from VOC data. "Sovereignty" is a money word. "Amazing" is not.

### 3. Loss Framing Multiplier
Joanna quantifies loss aversion at roughly 2x: people feel losses about twice as intensely as equivalent gains. This means "you're losing $500/month" is twice as motivating as "you'll save $500/month" — even though they describe the same outcome.

### 4. The 3-Option Architecture
The Goldilocks principle isn't just "offer 3 choices." The architecture matters: Option 1 should feel inadequate (anchors a floor), Option 3 should feel excessive (anchors a ceiling), and Option 2 should be the obvious choice. The spacing between options matters — too close and there's no contrast, too far and the middle feels arbitrary.

### 5. Toll Booth Detection
System 2 activates when it encounters: unfamiliar terminology, unexpected tone shifts, cognitive load (too many choices, complex sentences), broken expectations (a headline that doesn't match the body), or anything that requires "thinking." Each of these is a toll booth. Level 4 writers audit for and remove every one.

### 6. The Invisible Integration Test
Level 5 writing passes when a reader cannot identify where the persuasion techniques are. If someone reads your copy and says "that was really persuasive," you're at Level 3 or 4. If they say "I just knew I wanted it," you're at Level 5. The test is invisibility.
