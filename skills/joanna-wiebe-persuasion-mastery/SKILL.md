# Joanna Wiebe — Persuasion Mastery

## Overview

Joanna Wiebe is the founder of Copyhackers and the architect of the **5-Level Persuasion Hierarchy** — a progressive framework for writing copy that moves people to act without feeling "sold to."

## The 5 Levels

| Level | Name | Core Mechanism |
|-------|------|----------------|
| 1 | Junior Salesperson | Benefits over features (WIIFM) |
| 2 | Trickster | Cognitive biases operationalized |
| 3 | Influencer | Money words — identity language |
| 4 | Manipulator | System 1/2 traffic control |
| 5 | Story Seller | Invisible persuasion through narrative |

## Deployable Prompts

| Prompt | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| `persuasion-level-audit` | Score any copy on the 5-level framework |
| `money-words-miner` | Extract identity language from VOC data |
| `system-one-optimizer` | Remove System 2 toll booths from copy |
| `story-seller-framework` | Weave all 5 levels into invisible narrative |
| `cognitive-bias-toolkit` | Deploy the right bias at the right moment |
| `napoleon-identity-hook` | Identity-based CTAs and hooks |

## Key Principles

1. **Pronoun ratio reveals persuasion level** — Count first vs. second person
2. **Money words are NOT adjectives** — They're identity-specific nouns and verbs mined from VOC
3. **Losses hit 2x harder** — Loss framing always outperforms gain framing
4. **Toll booths wake System 2** — Any friction point breaks the automatic flow
5. **Level 5 passes the invisibility test** — Readers say "I just knew I wanted it"

## Quick Start

1. Read `references/genius-patterns.md` for full extraction
2. Run `persuasion-level-audit` on existing copy to diagnose current level
3. Use `money-words-miner` on audience VOC data to build language foundation
4. Apply `system-one-optimizer` to remove friction points
5. Use `story-seller-framework` for highest-stakes copy
