# Example Output: Defense Tech Recruiting Position

This example demonstrates the full Lulu Cheng Meservey methodology applied to a high-stakes recruiting campaign.

## Context

**Company:** Autonomous systems defense technology company  
**Challenge:** Need to recruit senior FAANG engineers who have ideological concerns about defense work  
**Goal:** Position that attracts mission-driven talent without alienating moderates

## The Communication

### Email Version: Direct Recruiting Outreach

**Subject:** We're not going to ask you to wrap yourself in a flag

I'm not going to give you a speech about patriotism.

I'm not going to tell you that you're a bad person if you don't join us.

Here's what I'm going to tell you:

There's a technology race happening. It's real. It's accelerating. And the outcome matters—not because of ideology, but because of what kind of world your kids grow up in.

Right now, there are engineers in Shenzhen working on autonomous systems. They're talented. They're motivated. And they're not debating whether it's ethical to build things that work.

I spent 10 years in Silicon Valley watching brilliant people optimize ad click-through rates. Some of those people are now at [Company] optimizing flight systems for machines that might determine whether democratic nations can defend themselves.

That's not a political statement. That's just physics and economics.

Here's what we actually care about:
- Can you solve problems that haven't been solved before?
- Can you ship systems that work in the real world, not just in demos?
- Can you build things you'd stake your reputation on?

We don't care who you voted for. We don't care about your Twitter takes. We don't care whether you think defense work is "cool" or whether you just think it's important.

We care about whether you're good.

If you're tired of impact theater and you want to work on problems where success isn't measured in engagement metrics—let's talk.

If you need to feel morally pure about every line of code—you're probably not for us. And that's okay. There are lots of places to work.

But if you've been secretly wondering whether there's something more meaningful than another CRUD app... maybe the answer isn't more politics. Maybe it's harder problems.

## Patterns Deployed

| Pattern | How It Appears |
|---------|----------------|
| First Person Monopoly | Only founder can speak this directly about mission |
| Gerrymandered Line | Unites all engineers who want impact, regardless of politics |
| Candy Coating | Wraps defense message in "impact vs. impact theater" zone |
| Emotional Altitude | Matches the intensity engineers feel about wasted potential |
| Ship-to-Yap Ratio | References real systems being built, not promises |

## Results (Hypothetical Based on Pattern)

- **Application surge:** 3x increase in senior engineer applications
- **Quality signal:** Higher percentage of candidates reference the specific message
- **Self-selection:** Candidates who apply are pre-aligned with mission
- **Internal morale:** Current team energized by positioning
- **Media pickup:** Position gets covered as thought leadership, not ad
