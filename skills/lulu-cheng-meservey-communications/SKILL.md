# Lulu Cheng Meservey: Communications Strategy & Narrative Architecture

## Overview

Lulu Cheng Meservey is the architect of the "Go Direct" communications movement—the philosophy that revolutionized how founders control their narratives in a decentralized media landscape. As founder of Rostra, former Head of Communications at Substack, and advisor to Anduril and Activision Blizzard, she has shaped narratives for billion-dollar companies during their most critical moments.

This skill captures her complete methodology for:
- **Founder-Led Direct Communication** — Bypassing media gatekeepers with authentic voice
- **Cultural Erogenous Zone Detection** — Finding what audiences want to say but can't articulate
- **Narrative Reality Architecture** — Creating stories that become operating truths
- **Attention-to-Value Conversion** — Turning viral moments into recruiting, sales, and funding
- **Strategic Positioning** — Drawing lines that unite your people against external opponents

## Core Philosophy

> "In a world of decentralized opinions, you must speak directly to your public. The gap between who you are at the bar and who you are publicly should be zilch."

The modern information landscape has fundamentally changed. Six TV channels no longer control the narrative—a random anonymous account can generate more momentum than CNN. This requires a complete paradigm shift in how companies communicate.

3. **Candy Coating:** Wrap commercial messages in what audiences already care about
4. **Emotional Altitude:** Match or exceed your audience's emotional intensity
5. **Deterrence Building:** Say what you'll do, then do it—build follow-through credibility
6. **Gerrymandered Lines:** Take bold positions that unite your people against external opponents
7. **Evanescent Conversion:** Treat viral moments as energy that must be immediately captured
