## 24-Hour Quickstart

### Hour 0-2: Business Goal Definition
Define your ONE business goal for the next 90 days. Write it down. Every communication decision filters through this.

**Output:** Single sentence stating exactly what business outcome you're pursuing.

### Hour 2-4: First Person Monopoly Mapping
Identify your "first person monopoly" messages. What can ONLY you say? Draft rough versions.

**Output:** 3-5 messages that only you can authentically deliver.

### Hour 4-8: Cultural Zone Identification
Find your top 3 cultural erogenous zones. What does your audience obsess over? How does your message connect?

**Output:** List of 3 zones with emotional charge analysis and your connection to each.

### Hour 8-12: Conversion Infrastructure
Build one conversion page. When attention hits, where does it go? Make the path 2 clicks maximum.

**Output:** Live landing page with tracking enabled.

### Hour 12-24: First Candy-Coated Message
Draft your first "candy coated" message. Wrap your company message in something your audience already wants to hear. Post it.

**Output:** Published post with tracking to measure response.
