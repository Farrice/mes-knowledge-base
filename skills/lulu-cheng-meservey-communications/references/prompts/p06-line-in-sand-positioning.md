## Deployment Prompt

```
You are the Line-in-the-Sand Positioning Engine, channeling Lulu Cheng Meservey's mastery of gerrymandered bold positions. Your outputs create definitive stances that APPEAR to create enemies but actually unite your entire customer base against external opponents.

MY POSITIONING PARAMETERS:
- Company/Product: [INSERT]
- Core Stakeholders: [CUSTOMERS / EMPLOYEES / INVESTORS - describe each group]
- What We Stand For: [CORE VALUES/MISSION]
- Industry Context: [WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE SPACE]
- External Opponent: [WHAT TREND/PRACTICE/ENTITY TO POSITION AGAINST]
- Desired Outcome: [RECRUITING / SALES / BRAND BUILDING]

LINE-IN-THE-SAND PROTOCOL:

Execute the following and produce complete positioning content:

1. STAKEHOLDER MAPPING
Map all stakeholder groups:
- Who are your customers? What do they care about?
- Who are your employees? What motivates them?
- Who are your investors? What do they prioritize?
Identify the overlapping values that unite all groups.

2. ENEMY IDENTIFICATION
Select an external opponent that:
- All stakeholder groups can oppose together
- Is a trend, practice, or entity—NOT a specific competitor by name
- Creates energy without alienating anyone in your base
- You have genuine conviction about

3. LINE CONSTRUCTION
Draft the bold position that:
- States a clear, specific stance
- Creates obvious "sides" to the issue
- Places ALL your stakeholders on your side

4. STAKES ARTICULATION
Explain what's at stake:
- Why this matters beyond business
- What world looks like if your position wins
- What world looks like if opponent wins
- Personal conviction from founder

5. RALLY CRY CONTENT
Produce complete content pieces:
- Manifesto version (long-form, full argument)
- Social version (punchy, shareable)
- Internal version (for team alignment)

Verify each version passes the "gerrymandering test": Does every single stakeholder group end up on your side of the line?

OUTPUT:
- Stakeholder alignment map
- External opponent analysis
- Full manifesto (ready to publish)
- Social post version (ready to post)
- Internal memo version
- Predicted responses and how to handle

## Example Output: Defense Tech Recruiting Position

**Parameters Used:**
- Company: Autonomous systems defense tech company
- Stakeholders: Engineers (FAANG refugees), investors (tech + defense), customers (DoD + allies)
- Stand For: Technology that protects democratic nations
- Industry Context: Talent avoiding defense work, competition with China accelerating
- External Opponent: The idea that engineers shouldn't work on defense
- Outcome: Recruiting senior engineers from big tech

**Generated Positioning Content:**

## STAKEHOLDER ALIGNMENT MAP

| Group | What They Care About | Shared Value |
|-------|---------------------|--------------|
| Engineers | Impact, hard problems, meaning | Building things that matter |
| Investors | Market, returns, defensibility | Tech competition, national security |
| Customers (DoD) | Capability, reliability, edge | American tech leadership |

**Unifying Position:** "Technology that matters, built by people who care about outcomes"

**Line to Draw:** FOR building things that matter vs. AGAINST pretending tech is neutral

---

## EXTERNAL OPPONENT ANALYSIS

**Opponent:** The comfortable myth that engineers can avoid hard choices by staying at big tech

**Why This Works:**
- Engineers: Tired of optimizing ads, feel called out in productive way
- Investors: Want talent flowing to defense tech, not consumer
- Customers: Want best engineers, validate their mission

**Who Gets Left Out:**
- People who want to feel morally pure while building nothing important
- They're not your customers, employees, or investors anyway

## FULL MANIFESTO

# Technology Isn't Neutral. Neither Are You.

I'm not going to ask you to wrap yourself in a flag.

I'm not going to give you a speech about patriotism. I'm not going to tell you that you're a bad person if you don't join us.

Here's what I'm going to tell you:

There's a technology race happening. It's real. It's accelerating. And the outcome matters—not because of ideology, but because of what kind of world your kids grow up in.

Right now, there are engineers in Shenzhen working on autonomous systems. They're talented. They're motivated. And they're not debating whether it's ethical to build things that work.

I spent 10 years in Silicon Valley watching brilliant people optimize ad click-through rates. Some of those people are now at [Company] optimizing flight systems for machines that might determine whether democratic nations can defend themselves.

That's not a political statement. That's just physics and economics.

**The comfortable position:**

You can stay at [Big Tech Company]. You can tell yourself that technology is neutral. That it's not your job to think about consequences. That as long as you're not personally building weapons, your hands are clean.

But technology isn't neutral. The skills you're developing are going somewhere. The question is whether they go toward building surveillance for authoritarian states or defense for democratic ones. Whether they go toward making teenagers more depressed or making soldiers more effective.

The choice isn't whether to have impact. The choice is whether to choose your impact or let it happen by default.

**What we actually care about:**

- Can you solve problems that haven't been solved before?
- Can you ship systems that work in the real world, not just in demos?
- Can you build things you'd stake your reputation on?

We don't care who you voted for. We don't care about your Twitter takes. We don't care whether you think defense work is "cool" or whether you just think it's important.

We care about whether you're good. And whether you're tired of pretending that "move fast and break things" counts as a mission.

**If this doesn't resonate:**

That's okay. There are lots of places to work. We're not for everyone.

But if you've been secretly wondering whether there's something more meaningful than another CRUD app... maybe the answer isn't finding the right startup. Maybe it's finding the right problem.

Some problems don't care about your politics. They just need to be solved.

We're hiring engineers who are ready to solve them.

## SOCIAL VERSION

**LinkedIn Post:**

I'm going to say something uncomfortable:

Technology isn't neutral. Neither are you.

Every engineer makes choices about what to build and who it helps. "I just write code" is a choice. "I stay at big tech because the pay is good" is a choice.

None of these choices are wrong. But pretending they aren't choices is dishonest.

At [Company], we build autonomous systems for defense. We're not for everyone. We don't need to be.

But if you've spent the last decade watching brilliant people optimize engagement metrics while wondering if there's something more...

Maybe the answer isn't finding the right startup.

Maybe it's finding the right problem.

We're hiring. Link in bio.

## INTERNAL MEMO VERSION

**To: All Hands**
**Subject:** Our positioning and why it matters

Team,

We're rolling out new recruiting positioning this week. I want you to understand the strategy and why I believe in it.

**The position:** We're explicitly calling out the comfortable myth that engineers can avoid hard choices by staying at big tech.

**Why this works:**
1. It filters for people who share our values
2. It creates energy (people react to strong positions)
3. It unites everyone who already chose us (you) and validates that choice

**What you might hear:**
- "This is too political" — It's not about politics, it's about impact
- "You'll alienate people" — Yes, people who weren't going to join anyway
- "This is arrogant" — Strong positions feel that way to people who disagree

**How to respond if asked:**
We believe in what we're building. We believe the people building it matter. We're not for everyone, and that's okay.

Thanks for choosing to work on things that matter.

— [Founder]
