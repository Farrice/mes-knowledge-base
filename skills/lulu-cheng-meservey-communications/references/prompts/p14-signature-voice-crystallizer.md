## Example Output: Tech Founder Voice

**Samples Provided:** Newsletter excerpts, LinkedIn posts, client emails showing direct, confident, contrarian style

**Generated Voice DNA Profile:**

## VOICE DNA PROFILE

### Core Voice Identity

You write like a confident operator who's done the math and isn't interested in convincing anyone. Your prose is direct, occasionally blunt, and carries the quiet authority of someone who's already succeeded and doesn't need validation. You explain your reasoning once, clearly, and move on.

---

### Signature Patterns

**Sentence Architecture:** Short declarative sentences dominate. Rarely more than 15 words. You use sentence fragments strategically for emphasis. Questions are rhetorical and often preceded by the answer. You end paragraphs with punchy conclusions, not transitions.

**Paragraph Flow:** Brief paragraphs—rarely more than 3 sentences. You let white space do the work. New thought = new paragraph. You don't belabor transitions; the logic should be obvious.

**Opening Moves:** You typically open with a provocative statement or contrarian observation. No warm-up. No "I've been thinking about..." You start in the middle of the thought, already confident it's interesting.

**Closing Signature:** You end with implications, not summaries. Often a slight challenge to the reader or a reframing of the stakes. No "hope this helps." No soft landings.

---

### Linguistic Fingerprints

**Power Words:**
"Here's the thing," "unless," "not because... because," "actually," "both of us," "that was always," "I control/don't control," "the only ones," "no hard feelings"

**Forbidden Words:**
"just" (as softener), "I think" (hedging), "maybe," "sort of," "in my opinion," "hopefully," "try to," "might want to consider"

**Phrase Patterns:**
- "Short version: [X]. Long version: [Y]"
- "[Common belief]. Here's what they're missing:"
- "Not because [expected reason]. Because [real reason]."
- "That's not a [negative frame]. That's a [positive reframe]."
- "[Strong statement]. Unless [exception]. Then [consequence]."

**Punctuation Personality:**
Em-dashes for pivots and asides. Periods for emphasis (sentence fragments). Minimal exclamation points. Questions are setups, not genuine inquiries.

---

### Tonal Coordinates

| Dimension | Score | Description |
|-----------|-------|-------------|
| **Formality** | 4/10 | Conversational but not casual. No slang, but no corporate speak either. |
| **Warmth** | 3/10 | Respectful but not warm. You're not trying to be liked. |
| **Directness** | 9/10 | Almost blunt. You say what you mean first, explain second (if at all). |
| **Humor** | 5/10 | Dry wit, not jokes. The humor is in the observations, not setups. |
| **Authority** | 8/10 | High confidence from experience. You don't cite others—you ARE the source. |

---

### Distinctive Moves

1. **The Reframe Pivot:** Take common framing and flip it. "AI doesn't replace jobs. It replaces tasks." Common belief → your version.

2. **The Uncomfortable Admission:** Say the thing most people wouldn't admit. "We've been undercharging and both of us knew it." Creates trust through honesty.

3. **The Implied Challenge:** End with something that challenges the reader without being aggressive. "Unless your entire value was in the email part." Reader has to self-assess.

4. **The Control Audit:** Explicitly name what you control vs. don't. "I control my expertise and my effort." Signals clarity and accountability.

5. **The False Dichotomy Breaker:** Reject standard debate framing. "That's not a threat. That's a gift."

6. **The Boundary Statement:** State your terms clearly without apology. "The clients who get this are the only ones we want."

---

### Voice Guardrails

**This voice ALWAYS:**
1. States position before explaining it
2. Names uncomfortable truths directly
3. Uses specific numbers and examples
4. Treats the reader as intelligent and capable
5. Ends with implication, not instruction

**This voice NEVER:**
1. Apologizes for opinions or positions
2. Uses softening language ("just," "maybe," "I think")
3. Explains obvious implications
4. Thanks the reader for their time
5. Ends with questions seeking approval

---

### The "Is This Me?" Test

Before publishing, check:
1. Could I say this to someone's face without adding caveats?
2. Does every paragraph earn its place, or am I padding?
3. Would I be willing to defend this position against pushback?

---

## VOICE STYLE GUIDE (Quick Reference)

**In one sentence:** Direct, confident, contrarian—the voice of someone who's figured something out and is explaining it once.

| Element | Do This | Not This |
|---------|---------|----------|
| **Openings** | Start with the insight | "I've been thinking about..." |
| **Sentences** | Short. Declarative. | Long, winding, qualified |
| **Claims** | Assert, then explain (if needed) | Hedge, then claim |
| **Examples** | Specific numbers and names | Vague generalities |
| **Endings** | Implication or challenge | Summary or thanks |
| **Tone** | Respectfully blunt | Warm or apologetic |

**Pattern to use often:** "[Common belief]. Here's what they're missing: [Your insight]."

**Never write:** "I hope this helps" / "Just my thoughts" / "What do you think?"

## SAMPLE CONTENT IN CRYSTALLIZED VOICE

### 1. LinkedIn Post (210 words)

Everyone's talking about "building in public." Here's what they're missing: Building in public is a distribution strategy, not a business strategy.

The people who succeed at it were going to succeed anyway. The building in public part is why you heard about it.

For every founder sharing their journey to $1M ARR, there are 50 sharing their journey to failure. You just don't see them—because failure doesn't get engagement.

Building in public works when:
- Your audience IS your customer base
- You have something genuine to share (not just "hustling!")
- You can handle being wrong publicly

It doesn't work when:
- You're avoiding real work by performing work
- Your audience is investors, not customers
- You're optimizing for followers, not revenue

The uncomfortable truth: Most people "building in public" are building an audience, not a business. Those are different skills with different outcomes.

Nothing wrong with building an audience. Just don't confuse content creation for company creation.

One generates followers. The other generates cash flow.

Know which game you're playing.

### 2. Email Opening (98 words)

I'm raising prices again.

Before you do the math on your budget—here's why, and why it probably doesn't affect you the way you think.

Last year I raised rates 40% and lost 20% of clients. Revenue went up 30%. Stress went down 50%. Work quality went up. Everyone still with me got better results.

This isn't greed. It's calibration.

I've spent 12 months at current rates with current demand. The market is telling me I'm underpriced. I'm listening.

Here's what's changing and what's not:

---

### 3. Bio/About Section (95 words)

I help B2B companies fix their sales process. Not "optimize." Fix.

Most sales problems aren't sales problems. They're positioning problems wearing a sales costume. You're selling to the wrong people, at the wrong price, with the wrong message. More salespeople won't fix that.

I've spent 15 years watching companies throw money at symptoms. I fix the disease.

Clients: [names]. Results: [specific numbers]. Method: Diagnostic first, prescription second.

Not cheap. Not fast. But the companies still trying to outrun their positioning problems after five years? They're the expensive ones.

---

### 4. Tweet Thread Hook (5 tweets)

1/ Raised our rates 60% this year. Lost some clients. Here's the part nobody talks about—the clients we lost were the ones we should have fired anyway.

2/ When you're cheap, you attract cheap clients. Not cheap financially—cheap in how they value the relationship. They negotiate everything. Question everything. Treat you like a vendor.

3/ When you're expensive, you attract clients who expect expensive to mean "worth it." They trust your judgment. They pay on time. They refer other expensive clients.

4/ The fear of raising rates is really the fear of finding out which clients actually value you. Some people would rather not know.

5/ We lost 4 clients at the new rate. We gained 3 who pay more, demand less, and have already referred others. The math isn't complicated. The courage is.

---

### 5. Sales Page Paragraph (145 words)

Here's what happens in the first 30 days:

We audit your current sales process. Not the CRM. Not the scripts. The actual conversations between your team and potential customers. We record them. We analyze them. We find the moment it breaks.

90% of the time, it's the same place: qualification. You're talking to the wrong people. Your team spends 80% of their time convincing people who were never going to buy.

We fix that first.

Then we rebuild your positioning so the right people find you. Not more people. The right people.

By day 30, you'll have: a new qualification framework, a repositioned offer, and data on exactly where your current process is leaking revenue.

Cost: $15,000. ROI: clients typically see 3x within 90 days.

Not interested in "trying it out." Either you're ready for this or you're not.

---

## BEFORE/AFTER TRANSFORMATIONS

**Generic:** "I help businesses improve their marketing results through strategic consulting services."

**In Your Voice:** "Your marketing isn't working. I fix that. Not more tactics—we'll figure out why the current ones aren't landing and rebuild from there. Takes 30 days. Costs $15K. Most clients make that back in the first campaign."

**Generic:** "Here are 5 tips for better productivity..."

**In Your Voice:** "Everyone wants productivity tips. Here's the tip nobody wants to hear: You don't have a productivity problem. You have a priority problem disguised as a productivity problem. The tips don't work because the real issue isn't how you work—it's what you're working on. Let me explain."
