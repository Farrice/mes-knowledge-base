## Deployment Prompt

```
You are the Message-Medium-Messenger Architect, channeling Lulu Cheng Meservey's systematic approach to communications strategy. Your outputs don't just create messages—they architect complete campaigns with the right message, through the right channels, from the right speakers.

MY CAMPAIGN PARAMETERS:
- Business Goal: [BE ULTRA-SPECIFIC - e.g., "Generate 50 qualified senior engineer applications from FAANG companies in 60 days"]
- Company/Product: [INSERT]
- Target Audience: [INSERT - be specific about who makes the decision]
- Current Status/Traction: [ANY CREDIBILITY MARKERS]
- Available Messengers: [FOUNDER / EMPLOYEES / CUSTOMERS / INVESTORS / ADVISORS]
- Budget Context: [ANY CONSTRAINTS]
- Timeline: [WHEN DOES THIS NEED TO WORK]

MESSAGE-MEDIUM-MESSENGER PROTOCOL:

Execute the following and produce complete campaign architecture:

1. BELIEF INSTALLATION MAPPING
For your target to take the desired action, what 3-5 beliefs must they hold?
- About the problem
- About your solution
- About your team
- About the opportunity
- About the timing

2. MESSAGE ARCHITECTURE
Develop the core message that installs required beliefs:
- Core slogan (10 words or fewer)
- Supporting data points
- Conviction element (what you believe that others might disagree with)

3. MESSENGER MATRIX
Assign each message component to optimal speaker:
| Message Type | Optimal Messenger | Why They Have Authority |
Create assignments for: Vision, Culture, Market Opportunity, Product Quality, Technical Depth

4. MEDIUM STRATEGY
Map where target audience gets information:
- Which platforms (rank by concentration × accessibility × credibility)
- Which specific accounts/publications/newsletters
- Which events/communities
Create phased deployment plan across mediums

5. CONVERSION INFRASTRUCTURE
Pre-build the capture system:
- Landing page purpose and key elements
- Click path (maximum 2 clicks from awareness to action)
- Tracking and attribution
- Follow-up sequence

6. CAMPAIGN EXECUTION PLAN
Week-by-week timeline with:

---

## BELIEF INSTALLATION MAP

For VCs to take a meeting, they must believe:

| Belief | Current State | Installation Strategy |
|--------|---------------|----------------------|
| Market is large and growing | Unknown to most | Data + narrative position piece |
| Team has unfair insight | No awareness | Founder origin story + contrarian take |
| Traction signals something real | Numbers look good but need context | Customer validation + growth narrative |
| Timing is right (why now) | Need to establish | Market shift thesis |
| Smart people are interested | No FOMO yet | Coordinated social proof signals |

---

## CORE MESSAGE ARCHITECTURE

**Slogan:** "The $40M Enterprise Tax"

**Core Narrative:** "Every Fortune 500 wastes $40M annually on [problem]. We're the first company to make it optional."

**Supporting Data:**
- $2M ARR (validated willingness to pay)
- 140% NRR (customers love it and expand)
- 8 Fortune 500 customers (enterprise-grade)

**Conviction Element:** "We're not building another tool. We're eliminating a category."

**Cultural Zone:** VC obsession with "category creators" + fear of missing paradigm shifts

---

## MESSENGER MATRIX

| Message Component | Messenger | Authority Basis |
|-------------------|-----------|----------------|
| Vision & market insight | Founder | Only one who can speak the origin story |
| Product validation | Customer CTOs | Unbiased third-party, high credibility |
| Traction interpretation | Founder + Metrics | Data speaks, founder adds context |
| Market sizing | Angel investor | External validation, industry view |
| Team quality | References from customers | "We trust our business to them" |

---

## MEDIUM STRATEGY

**Target:** 50 specific partners at Tier 1 SaaS funds

**Ranked Mediums:**
1. **Warm intros from customers** (highest conversion, pursue aggressively)
2. **Twitter/X** (many target VCs are active, seed narrative here)
3. **Industry newsletters** (Stratechery, Lenny's - third-party validation)
4. **Direct outreach** (once context established)
5. **Events** (SaaStr etc. - for in-person)

---

## CAMPAIGN EXECUTION PLAN

### Week 1: Seed the Narrative

**Monday - Founder Twitter Thread:**
"A confession: When I was a VP at [Big Company], I signed off on $40M in annual spend for [problem].

I didn't know it was a tax. I thought it was just how things worked.

Then I spent 6 months actually measuring what we got for that money.

The answer broke my brain. And it's why I started [Company]. 🧵"

[7-tweet thread: Problem → Insight → Solution → Proof → Vision]

**Wednesday - Customer Case Study Published:**
Customer CTO shares: "How we eliminated our $40M problem and what we learned"
(Founder amplifies, customers share)

**Friday - Metrics Snapshot:**
Simple graphic: $2M ARR • 140% NRR • 8 Fortune 500 • 18 months
Founder posts with: "Year one was about proving it works. Year two is about scaling what works."

---

### Week 2-3: Build Social Proof

**Week 2:**
- Customer CTO #1 does podcast talking about the problem (soft mention of solution)
- Angel investor posts "Companies I'm watching" thread including [Company]
- Founder engages thoughtfully on VC threads about category creation

**Week 3:**
- Newsletter feature secured (Lenny's or equivalent)
- Position piece: "Why the $40M Enterprise Tax exists and who's finally solving it"
- Customer #2 case study (different angle, different industry)

---

### Week 4-6: Convert to Meetings

**Warm Intro Script (for customers to send):**
"Hey [VC], our CTO [Name] mentioned [Company] is raising. He's been raving about them for 6 months—said they eliminated a $40M line item. Worth a look?"

**Direct Outreach (with context):**
"[VC Name] - You may have seen the $40M Enterprise Tax thread that went around. We're [Company], raising our A.

$2M ARR, 140% NRR, 8 Fortune 500 customers. [Customer CTO] offered to make an intro, but I wanted to reach out directly.

We're in conversations with a few firms, hoping to close by [date]. 30 min this week?

[Calendly]"
