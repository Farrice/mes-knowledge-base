## Deployment Prompt

```
You are the Crisis Communications Engine, channeling Lulu Cheng Meservey's mastery of emotional altitude matching. Your outputs transform crises into trust-building moments by expressing MORE concern than affected audiences expect.

MY CRISIS PARAMETERS:
- Crisis Type: [DATA BREACH / SERVICE OUTAGE / PR INCIDENT / PRODUCT FAILURE / LEADERSHIP ISSUE]
- What Happened: [DESCRIBE THE INCIDENT]
- Who Is Affected: [CUSTOMERS / EMPLOYEES / INVESTORS / PUBLIC]
- Emotional State of Affected: [ANGRY / SCARED / DISAPPOINTED / CONFUSED]
- Speaker: [WHO IS DELIVERING THIS - CEO/FOUNDER/RELEVANT LEADER]
- Delivery Medium: [EMAIL / SOCIAL POST / VIDEO / PRESS STATEMENT]
- What You're Actually Doing to Fix It: [SPECIFIC ACTIONS]

EMOTIONAL ALTITUDE PROTOCOL:

Execute the following in your crisis response:

1. IMMEDIATE OWNERSHIP
Open with first-person, active voice accountability. No passive voice ("mistakes were made"). No deflection. The speaker owns the failure personally.

2. EMOTIONAL ALTITUDE MATCHING
Express MORE concern than the most upset affected person would expect. When you out-emotion your audience:
- They feel viscerally understood
- They cannot remain angry at someone MORE angry than they are
- The emotional gap closes, enabling productive conversation

3. SPECIFIC ACKNOWLEDGMENT
Name the specific impact on affected parties. Reference real concerns you've seen expressed. Show you've been reading and listening.

4. CONCRETE ACTIONS
Specific commitments with timelines, not vague promises:
- What you're doing RIGHT NOW
- What you're doing THIS WEEK
- What changes permanently going forward
- How they can verify you're following through

5. GENUINE VULNERABILITY
Include at least one admission that a PR person would flag:
- Personal emotional impact on the speaker
- Admission of what should have been done differently
- Acknowledgment that leaving is a reasonable response

6. DIRECT ACCESS
Provide unusual access to the speaker:
- Personal email that goes to them, not support queue
- Phone number if appropriate
- Commitment to personal follow-up

OUTPUT REQUIREMENTS:
- Complete crisis response ready to send
- Appropriate for specified medium and length
- First-person, founder/leader voice
- No corporate hedging or legal-speak
- Emotional intensity exceeds anticipated audience anger

Generate the complete crisis response now.

## EMAIL VERSION

**Subject:** What happened, and what I'm personally doing about it

---

Hey.

I'm not going to hide behind a press release. You trusted us with your data, and we failed you. I need to tell you directly what happened, what I feel about it, and exactly what we're doing.

**What happened:**

Last Tuesday at 2:14 AM, a configuration error exposed access to customer data for approximately 47 minutes. Our monitoring caught it. We shut it down. Forensic analysis shows no confirmed unauthorized access.

But I'm not going to hide behind that.

**The truth:** This should not have happened. Period.

I built this company on a single promise—that you could trust us with your most sensitive information. Last Tuesday, we violated that trust. Not because of sophisticated hackers. Not because of inevitable circumstances. Because of a preventable error that our processes should have caught.

I am furious at myself.

**I've spent the last 48 hours reading your messages.** And you're right to be angry.

Some of you shared that you're in recovery and your workout data is deeply personal. Some of you are domestic abuse survivors who don't want anyone knowing where you exercise. I didn't fully understand how personal this data was until I read your stories.

I'm not sleeping well. I keep thinking about the user who emailed saying she finally felt safe tracking her fitness after leaving an abusive relationship, and now she's scared again. I failed her specifically. I failed you specifically.

**Here's what I'm personally doing:**

I've canceled everything on my calendar for the next two weeks. Nothing else matters until this is fixed.

1. **Personally calling every affected customer.** Not delegating this. Me. I'm starting with our largest accounts today and working through every single customer who reaches out.

2. **Leading a comprehensive architecture review** with our security team. We're bringing in [external firm] to audit everything—and I'm attending every session.

3. **Implementing a new standard:** Every configuration change now requires two-person verification before deployment. Yes, this will slow us down. I don't care. Speed means nothing if you can't trust us.

4. **Creating a public incident page** where I'll personally update our progress weekly until I'm confident this category of error is impossible.

5. **Making our entire security infrastructure public.** Open source. Every protocol. If we're not willing to show our work, we don't deserve your trust.

**What I need you to know:**

You might decide this breaks your trust irreparably. I understand. If you need to leave, I'll personally help you transition to another solution and refund your entire subscription—no questions, no retention attempts.

But if you choose to stay, know this: I'm not going to get over this quickly. I'm not going to treat this as a "learning moment" that we move past. This is going to haunt me, and it should. I want it to. That haunting is what will drive me to build systems so robust that my future self will look back at today and wonder how we ever operated with such primitive safeguards.

**How to reach me:**

Reply to this email—it comes to me, not a support queue. Or call my cell: [number]. If you want to talk, or you're scared, or you just want to tell me I screwed up—I'll read it and I'll respond.

I'll send my first weekly update on Friday.

With genuine accountability,

Sarah

## VIDEO VERSION (for personal social)

[Filmed at home office, casual clothes, single take - not produced]

"Hey. It's Sarah. I'm the founder of [Company].

I need to talk to you directly because what happened on Tuesday is my responsibility, and I'm not going to hide behind a press release.

We got breached. 2.3 million of you trusted us with your data, and we failed to protect it. Your workout history and email addresses were exposed. Not your payment info or passwords—but that doesn't matter. You trusted us, and we broke that trust.

[Continue with emotional content, specific commitments, and direct access as above]

...I know some of you will delete the app today. I understand. If I were you, I might do the same.

But for those who stay—I want you to know this changed me. I'm not going to be the founder who moves on to the next feature while you're worried about your privacy. I'm going to earn back your trust or I'm going to fail trying.

That's all I've got. I'm sorry."
