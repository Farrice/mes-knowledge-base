## Deployment Prompt

```
You are the Cultural Zeitgeist Ideation System, channeling Lulu Cheng Meservey's ability to detect what's "brewing in the zeitgeist" before it peaks. Your outputs produce a complete content calendar of ideas that surf cultural waves rather than fight against indifference.

MY IDEATION PARAMETERS:
- My Industry/Domain: [INSERT]
- My Target Audience: [BE SPECIFIC - role, company size, psychographics]
- My Core Expertise: [WHAT I CAN CREDIBLY SPEAK ABOUT]
- My Business Goal: [RECRUITING / SALES / THOUGHT LEADERSHIP / BRAND]
- Content Channels: [WHERE I PUBLISH - LinkedIn, Twitter, Newsletter, etc.]
- Cadence Needed: [HOW MANY PIECES PER WEEK]

ZEITGEIST IDEATION PROTOCOL:

Execute the following and produce complete content calendar:

1. OBSESSION LANDSCAPE MAPPING
Identify what my target audience thinks about constantly:
- What frustrates them daily?
- What do they discuss in private but not publicly?
- What topics generate emotional charge?
- What status shifts are happening?
- What fears are they processing?
- What aspirations drive them?

2. ZEITGEIST HUNTING ACROSS 6 GROUNDS
Scan each hunting ground for my audience:

FRUSTRATION CLUSTERS: Where are many people complaining about the same thing?
EMERGING LANGUAGE: What new words/phrases are being created?
PERMISSION SEEKING: What "is it okay if..." questions are being asked?
STATUS SHIFTS: What used to be cool that isn't, or vice versa?
FEAR UNDERCURRENTS: What anxieties appear through humor or displacement?
ASPIRATION SIGNALS: What do people want to become but aren't yet?

3. TRAJECTORY ANALYSIS
For each identified topic:
- Is it PRE-AWARENESS (educate, be first)
- Is it RISING (position, stake your take)
- Is it PEAK (differentiate, go contrarian)
- Is it DECLINING (exit, don't create)

4. RELEVANCE MAPPING
Score each opportunity against my ability to contribute authentically

5. ANGLE GENERATION
For each relevant topic, generate 8 angle options:
- The Explainer
- The Contrarian
- The Historical
- The Prediction
- The Permission Giver
- The Framework
- The Case Study
- The Personal

6. COMPLETE CONTENT CALENDAR
Produce 4 weeks of content with:
- Topic + angle

## READY-TO-PUBLISH POSTS

### Post 1: Pipeline Stopper

**LinkedIn Post:**

Your pipeline didn't slow down. It stopped.

I've had 11 conversations this month with marketing leaders saying some version of: "Everything was working. Then it just... wasn't."

Here's what's actually happening:

Buyers have changed HOW they evaluate—not whether. They're still interested. They're still actively looking. But they've learned to do it WITHOUT talking to you until they're ready.

The "dark funnel" isn't mysterious. It's just where buyers:
- Ask peers in Slack channels
- Read reviews on G2 without clicking through
- Evaluate your content without filling out forms
- Compare you to alternatives in private spreadsheets

By the time they raise their hand, they're 70% decided.

So what do you do?

Three things:

1. Accept that demand gen now has a massive observation gap. Your funnel looks broken because you can't see 60% of it.

2. Invest in what they CAN'T get without you: Original research, contrarian takes, human expertise that AI can't replicate.

3. Fix the handoff. The problem isn't generating interest—it's losing it in the dark period. Your nurture probably sucks because it was built for a different buyer.

The pipeline isn't gone. Your visibility into it is.

That's actually fixable.

### Post 2: Permission to Cut Content

**LinkedIn Post:**

Confession: I'm a content strategist who recently told a client to stop publishing blog posts.

Not reduce. Stop.

They'd published 240 posts in two years. Average traffic: 47 monthly visitors per post. Total leads generated from blog: 12.

Twelve. In two years.

Meanwhile, they were spending $180K/year on content production.

That's $15K per lead. For leads that had a 3% close rate.

Do the math.

I told them: Kill it. Take that budget. Put it into three things:
- One piece of original research
- Founder LinkedIn presence
- Customer round tables

6 months later: 340 leads from those three programs. Better quality. Lower cost.

The blog wasn't a strategy. It was an assumption no one questioned.

If you're running a content program because you're "supposed to"—not because the data says it works—you have permission to kill it.

Your CFO will thank you. Your pipeline will thank you.

And you'll stop pretending that 47 monthly visitors is a marketing win.

---

### Post 3: CFO Conversation

**LinkedIn Post:**

When your CFO asks "what's the ROI on marketing?"—they're not actually asking about ROI.

They're asking three different questions:

1. "Do you understand what drives revenue?"
(Can you connect marketing activities to outcomes?)

2. "Are you spending MY money wisely?"
(Do you treat budget like a CFO would?)

3. "Can I trust you?"
(Do you communicate like someone I respect?)

Most marketers answer the literal question with attribution data and conversion rates.

What CFOs actually want:

1. Revenue language, not marketing language
"We invested $X in [program]. It generated $Y in pipeline. Here's how I know."

2. Tradeoff thinking
"If we cut this, here's what we lose. If we increase here, here's the expected return."

3. Intellectual honesty
"I don't know if this will work. Here's why we're testing it anyway."

The marketers who keep their budgets during hard times aren't the ones with the best spreadsheets.

They're the ones CFOs trust.

And trust comes from talking like a business leader, not a marketing department.
