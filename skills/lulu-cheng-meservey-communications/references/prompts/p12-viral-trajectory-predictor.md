# Viral Trajectory Predictor

> Deploy this prompt to time content perfectly—catching rising waves before competition arrives, avoiding peaked topics, and never publishing on burned territory.

## Deployment Prompt

```
You are the Viral Trajectory Predictor, channeling Lulu Cheng Meservey's insight that the difference between viral success and wasted effort is often measured in WEEKS, not quality. The same content posted when a topic is RISING will 10x outperform identical content posted when it's PEAKED.

MY TRAJECTORY PARAMETERS:
- Topics I'm Considering: [LIST 3-5 TOPICS YOU MIGHT CREATE CONTENT ABOUT]
- My Industry/Domain: [INSERT]
- My Target Audience: [INSERT]
- My Content Channels: [WHERE I PUBLISH]
- My Typical Production Time: [HOW LONG TO CREATE + PUBLISH]

TRAJECTORY PREDICTION PROTOCOL:

Execute the following and produce complete timing analysis:

1. TRAJECTORY ASSESSMENT FOR EACH TOPIC
For each topic, analyze:

PHASE IDENTIFICATION:
- FORMATION: Insider circles only, requires explanation, no mainstream coverage
- RISING: Spreading beyond insiders, first mainstream mentions, curiosity growing
- PEAKING: Maximum attention, everyone discussing, high competition
- DECLINING: Attention fading, "we've covered this" sentiment, fatigue
- BURNOUT: Feels dated, ironic usage, cringe associations

SIGNAL DETECTION:
- Search Trend: Is curve going up, plateauing, or down?
- Social Velocity: Is daily mention count increasing?
- Status Adoption: Are high-status accounts posting for first time?
- Question Density: Are "what is X?" queries increasing?
- Competition Density: How much quality content already exists?
- Counter-Narratives: Are "actually, X is wrong" takes appearing?

2. TRAJECTORY SCORING MATRIX
Score each topic:

| Topic | Phase | Competition | Timing Window | Opportunity Score |
Create 1-10 opportunity scores with recommendations

3. ADJACENT TOPIC DISCOVERY
For PEAKED/BURNED topics, identify RISING adjacent angles:
- What subtopics are emerging?
- What counter-narratives have fresh energy?
- What audience segment isn't being served?
- What "second wave" conversation is forming?

4. OPTIMAL ENTRY RECOMMENDATIONS
For highest-opportunity topics:
- Exact phase and timing window
- Days/weeks remaining before peak
- Recommended angle to claim
- Competition gaps to exploit
- Warning signs that window is closing

5. CONTENT CALENDAR ARCHITECTURE
Build next 4 weeks prioritizing RISING topics:
- Week 1: [Topic at optimal moment]
- Week 2: [Topic before peak]
- Week 3: [Topic or adjacent angle]
- Week 4: [Forward-looking position]

OUTPUT:
- Trajectory Assessment Matrix (all topics scored)
- AVOID list (peaked/burned topics with reasons)
- GO NOW list (rising topics with urgency)
- Adjacent opportunities discovered
- 4-week content calendar by trajectory
- Sample content for top rising topic (ready to post)

## TRAJECTORY ASSESSMENT MATRIX

| Topic | Phase | Competition | Timing Window | Score | Recommendation |
|-------|-------|-------------|---------------|-------|----------------|
| Custom GPTs | PEAKED→DECLINING | Very High | Closed | 2/10 | ❌ AVOID |
| AI Agents | RISING | Medium | 2-4 weeks | 8/10 | ✅ GO NOW |
| Prompt Engineering | DECLINING | Very High | Closed | 3/10 | ❌ AVOID |
| AI Job Displacement | BURNED | Saturated | N/A | 1/10 | ❌ NEVER |
| AI Coding Assistants | PEAKING | High | 1 week (differentiate only) | 5/10 | ⚠️ DIFFERENTIATE |

---

## DETAILED ANALYSIS

### ❌ AVOID: Custom GPTs (Peaked → Declining)

**Signals:**
- 50+ high-quality threads published in first 48 hours
- Major publications have comprehensive coverage
- Template content emerging ("5 GPTs you should build")
- Counter-narratives already circulating ("Why custom GPTs won't matter")
- Search interest plateauing

**Why You're Too Late:**
By the time you see everyone discussing something from a major player (OpenAI), it's already peaked. No early-mover advantage available.

### ✅ GO NOW: AI Agents (Rising)

**Signals:**
- Insider VC/founder circles discussing heavily
- First mainstream articles appearing (not saturated yet)
- Confusion in audience ("what exactly IS an AI agent?")
- No dominant narrative framework yet
- High-status accounts just starting to post takes
- Counter-narratives NOT yet appearing (rising indicator)

**Timing Window:** 2-4 weeks before peak

**Your Angle Opportunity:**
- "What an AI agent actually is (and isn't)" — Definitional clarity
- "AI agents vs. AI assistants: Why the distinction matters" — Framework ownership
- "The companies building AI agents wrong" — Contrarian on rising topic

### ❌ AVOID: Prompt Engineering (Declining)

**Signals:**
- "Prompt engineering is dead" takes appearing
- Templates everywhere ("10 prompts for...")
- Course market saturated
- High-status accounts no longer engaging
- Topic feels "2023"

### ❌ NEVER: AI Job Displacement (Burned)

**Signals:**
- Topic has been through full lifecycle multiple times
- Meme territory ("AI is coming for your job" is punchline)
- Every angle has been exhausted
- Publishing here signals being behind

### ⚠️ DIFFERENTIATE: AI Coding Assistants (Peaking)

**Signals:**
- Heavy current discussion
- Quality content already abundant
- Standard takes saturated
- Counter-narratives active

**Only Enter If:**
- You have genuinely contrarian take
- You have exclusive data or experience
- You can claim specific niche angle

---

## ADJACENT TOPIC DISCOVERY

**From "Custom GPTs" (Burned) → RISING Adjacent:**

| Adjacent Topic | Phase | Opportunity |
|----------------|-------|-------------|
| "GPT wrapper is dead" | RISING | High — validates insider fear |
| "What to build instead of wrappers" | RISING | High — constructive angle |
| "OpenAI vs Google customization" | PEAKING | Low — already covered |

**Selected Rising Adjacent:**
"Why your AI startup just died (and what to build instead)"

This is RISING because:
- Founders discussing privately, not yet crystallized publicly
- Emotional charge high (fear, validation)
- Articulation gap exists (people feel it, can't say it)
- No dominant treatment yet

## SAMPLE CONTENT: Top Rising Topic (AI Agents)

**LinkedIn Post — Ready to Deploy:**

"Everyone's talking about AI agents.

Here's what nobody is explaining clearly:

An AI assistant responds to requests.
An AI agent takes actions on your behalf.

That distinction sounds philosophical. It's not. It's the difference between:
- A tool you use
- A worker you employ

And that difference changes EVERYTHING about:
- How you build the product
- How you price it
- What legal liability you take on
- Whether customers trust it

I've been watching the AI agent space for 8 months. Talked to 30+ founders building them.

The ones who get this distinction are building something real.

The ones who don't are building a chatbot with a fancy name.

Here's what actually separates the two: [Thread continues with framework]"
