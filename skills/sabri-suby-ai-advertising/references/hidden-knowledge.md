# Sabri Suby Hidden Knowledge

7 tacit insights for AI-powered advertising success.

---

## 1. The $101M Validation Shortcut
**Insight**: When a company has raised significant VC, their due diligence has already validated the market. VCs aren't stupid—they've done extensive validation you can piggyback on.

**Deploy**: Check Crunchbase for competitor funding. $10M+ raised = market extensively validated by professional investors.

## 2. The SaaS vs. Service Decision
**Insight**: Sabri immediately rejects opportunities requiring SaaS/coding—even great markets. He has internal filter for "zero capital, no coding, immediate deploy" opportunities.

**Deploy**: Filter all opportunities: Can I deliver as a service without building technology? Y = proceed. N = skip.

---

## 3. The Price Point Sweet Spot
**Insight**: He dislikes $300-$1,000/month models and prefers higher. CAC is relatively fixed, so higher price points = better unit economics.

**Deploy**: Target $2,000+/month or $5,000+ one-time. Below this, CAC makes profitability difficult.

---

## 4. "Show The Product Working" Multiplier
**Insight**: He criticized competitors for static images instead of live demonstrations. Letting prospects EXPERIENCE the product converts dramatically better than describing it.

**Deploy**: Every landing page needs interactive demo, live preview, or "try it now" element.

---

## 5. Facebook-First Validation
**Insight**: His instinct is Facebook Ads Library first, Google Ads Transparency second. Facebook ad presence is primary validation signal.

**Deploy**: Check Facebook Ads Library as step 1 for ANY business validation. Presence = validation. Absence = caution.

---

## 6. "Assemble, Don't Create" Copy Philosophy
**Insight**: "We don't write ads, we assemble ads." Raw material (pain points, desires, exact language) comes from research. Copywriter's job is arrangement, not invention.

**Deploy**: Never start from blank page. Start with 50+ verbatim prospect quotes, then arrange into persuasive sequence.

---

## 7. Social Proof Deletion Protocol
**Insight**: When starting from zero, he deletes proof/testimonial sections rather than faking. Weak proof is worse than no proof.

**Deploy**: If you don't have legitimate proof, remove proof sections entirely. Never fabricate or exaggerate.
