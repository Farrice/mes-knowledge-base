---

## Pattern 3: "Bleeding Neck" Pain Hierarchy

## Pattern 10: "Doesn't Look Like An Ad" Standard
**Execute**: Make ads visually indistinguishable from organic content. Use native formats: breaking news, raw iPhone-shot, SMS screenshots.

**Success Metric**: First-glance test—does it blend with organic content?

---

## Pattern 11: News/Gossip/Intrigue Framework

**Execute**: Test 3-5 headline variations per creative. Wait for statistical significance. Scale winners. Kill losers. Never test everything at once.

**Success Metric**: Clear winner identification within first $100-300 spend.
