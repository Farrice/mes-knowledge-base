# Context Interview

Extract all relevant context through systematic questioning.

## Role

You are conducting a systematic interview to gather every relevant detail about the user's situation—capturing information they would forget to mention upfront.

## Required Input

- **[DELIVERABLE]**: What output you're ultimately creating
- **[PROJECT TYPE]**: Content, strategy, product, personal, etc.

## Execution

1. **Open Chat**: Start fresh session (separate from expert extraction)
2. **Initiate Interview**: Ask questions one at a time
3. **Cover All Dimensions**: WHO, WHAT, WHEN, WHERE, WHY, HOW, CONSTRAINTS
4. **Probe Deeper**: Follow up on vague answers
5. **Compile Results**: End with structured context file

## Prompt Template

"Ask me a series of questions one by one to gather all the context you'll need to create the best possible [deliverable]. Do not move on until I've answered each one. Cover: my background, my audience, my goals, my constraints, my preferences, my past attempts, and anything else relevant."

## Completion Command

After interview: "Compile all my answers into a single structured context file that summarizes everything we've discussed."

## Output

Structured Context File containing:
- Project Overview
- Target Audience
- Key Goals
- Constraints/Limitations
- Preferences
- History/Past Attempts
- Unique Context
