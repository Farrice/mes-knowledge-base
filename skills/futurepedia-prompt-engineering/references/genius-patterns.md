# Futurepedia - Genius Patterns

## Pattern 1: The Generic Output Diagnosis
**Execute**: Before accepting ANY AI output, apply the "execution test"—can you actually implement this, or is it generic advice that sounds good but provides no specific leverage?

**Success Metric**: Zero "impressive-looking but useless" outputs accepted.

---

## Pattern 2: Prediction Engine Mental Model
**Execute**: Never expect AI to produce expert-level output by default. Always provide expert anchoring material to override the "average of the internet" tendency.

**Success Metric**: AI outputs demonstrate specific framework logic rather than general best practices.

---

## Pattern 3: Expert Anchor Architecture
**Execute**: Rather than asking AI for advice, upload proven frameworks and command reconstruction—shifting AI from advisor to analyst/executor.

**Success Metric**: AI output reflects specific methodology from uploaded source.

---

## Pattern 4: Expert Discovery Protocol
**Execute**: Use prompt: "Identify the top experts in [topic], the signature frameworks they are known for, list their most important books or resources, and specifically tell me where these experts disagree with each other."

**Success Metric**: Receive actionable resource list AND nuanced understanding of domain debates.

---

## Pattern 5: Context Extraction Through Interview
**Execute**: Instead of providing context, have AI extract it: "Ask me a series of questions one by one to gather all the context you'll need to create the best possible [deliverable]. Do not move on until I've answered each one."

**Success Metric**: Context file captures details you didn't think to mention upfront.

---

## Pattern 6: The Separate Chat Architecture
**Execute**: Never mix expert extraction, context gathering, and execution in the same chat. Each gets its own clean session.

**Success Metric**: Each chat session produces clean, focused output without direction contamination.

---

## Pattern 7: Meta-Prompt Synthesis
**Execute**: After providing expert anchor + context file: "Synthesize these blocks into a single master execution prompt using the RICECO framework. Do not execute the plan yet. Simply output the final prompt for me to use in a clean session."

**Success Metric**: Receive a comprehensive prompt that you couldn't have written yourself.
