## Tacit 1: Plan Abandonment Prevention
When AI tries to plan AND execute simultaneously, its attention splits and it defaults back to generic advice. The three-step separation prevents this failure mode.

**Deploy**: Always separate information gathering from execution. Complex tasks require staged workflows, not single mega-prompts.

## Tacit 2: XML Tag Structuring
Using XML tags (`<expert_anchor>`, `<context_file>`) helps AI understand information boundaries. This isn't formatting preference—it's architectural clarity that improves processing.

**Deploy**: Wrap distinct information blocks in XML tags in complex prompts.

## Tacit 3: The "Reconstruct, Don't Summarize" Command
Summaries lose operational detail. Reconstructions preserve the executable system. The word choice "reconstruct" versus "summarize" fundamentally changes output quality.

**Deploy**: Always use "reconstruct the system" rather than "summarize" when extracting frameworks.

---

## Tacit 4: Momentum Resistance
"Once an AI is mid-response, it's much harder to restructure. It has momentum. It tries to stick to the direction it's already going."

**Deploy**: Front-load ALL context before AI begins generating. Never try to redirect mid-stream—start fresh chat instead.

## Tacit 5: The Interview Completion Command
After the context interview, a final command compiles everything: "Compile all my answers into a single structured context file that summarizes everything we've discussed."

**Deploy**: Always end context extraction with compilation command to create portable context asset.
