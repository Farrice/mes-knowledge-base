# Alen Sultanic Copywriting Mastery

Architect offers that align with the deepest drivers of human behavior—all purchasing decisions filter through four primal needs.

## Overview

Alen Sultanic is a Direct Response Strategist who scaled offers from $100K to $3M/month. His genius: understanding that all purchases are fundamentally trade-off calculations happening in real-time across four primal human needs (Survival, Reproduction, Safety/Security, Status). Mastery means engineering conditions where buyers convince themselves.

**Core philosophy**: Copywriters think they sell future feelings. Actually, you create the feeling DURING the sales process, then position payment as keeping the feeling.
