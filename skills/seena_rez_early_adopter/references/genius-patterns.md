# Genius Patterns: Seena Rez

## 1. The "Day in the Life" Data Scrape
**Concept**: Traditional product research tools (JungleScout, Helium10) show you what HAS sold. Vlogs show you what IS ABOUT to sell.
**Mechanism**:
- People don't lie in their vlogs about their daily struggles.
- When they say "I wish I had..." or "I finally found these...", that is raw, validated demand.
- **The "Generic Name" Signal**: If they call a product by its description ("grippy socks") rather than a brand name ("Nike socks"), the market is wide open.

## 2. Identity Mirroring (The Glossier Effect)
**Concept**: Brand loyalty is transferrable between non-competing categories if the *Identity* matches.
**Mechanism**:
- Identify the "Tribal Leader" brand in a different vertical (e.g., Glossier for skincare).
- Analyze their "Visual API":
    - Filter/Preset used? (e.g., Cloudy, pastel).
    - Model look? (e.g., minimal makeup, freckles).
    - Font/Typography?
- Replicate this *exact* visual language for your new product. The customer's brain auto-associates your new brand with their meaningful loyalty to the old brand.

## 3. The 3-Second Dopamine Reveal
**Concept**: Virality is structural, not accidental.
**Mechanism**:
- **0:00 - 0:02**: "The Hook/Context". Must be relatable or shocking. "Wait for it..."
- **0:03 EXACTLY**: "The X-Factor".
    - Audio: Beat drop or sound effect change.
    - Visual: Rapid cut, color change, or "reveal" of the product.
- **Why**: This resets the user's attention span (looping the dopamine) just as they were about to scroll.

## 4. Retargeting the "Warm" Viewer
**Concept**: Don't sell to cold traffic. Sell to "engaged" identifiers.
**Mechanism**:
- Run viral organic content (using the 3-Second Rule).
- Create a Custom Audience: "People who watched 50% of video".
- Run "Static Image" ads to this audience.
- **Logic**: They know the problem (video 1). They know the vibe (branding). Now they just need the offer (ad).
