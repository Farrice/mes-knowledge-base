6 tacit insights for emotional storytelling mastery.

---

## 1. Sound Is Emotional Umami
**Insight**: Sound creates emotional depth that can't be articulated but is felt. Like umami in food—you can't identify it but you crave it.
**Deploy**: Add sensory layers that create "can't place but can't forget" effect.

## 2. All Innovation Emerges From Adversity
**Insight**: Breakthrough comes from setbacks, disasters, friction. Smooth paths don't produce exceptional outcomes.
**Deploy**: Design deliberate oscillation—problems that force innovation.

## 3. Empty Calories vs. Nourishment
**Insight**: Most content is fast food—instant but forgettable. Great content is Michelin—worth returning to repeatedly.
**Deploy**: Create content with infinite consumption value.

## 4. Body Knows Before Mind
**Insight**: Physical truth is undeniable. Connect claims to body experiences audiences already have.
**Deploy**: Ground arguments in felt experience, not logic alone.

## 5. Self-Proving Eliminates Objection
**Insight**: Arguments that audiences verify themselves bypass all resistance.
**Deploy**: Let them experience truth, don't just tell them.

## 6. Continuums Reveal Hidden Patterns
**Insight**: Placing concepts on spectrum reveals insights invisible in isolation.
**Deploy**: Map positions to show relationships and gaps.
