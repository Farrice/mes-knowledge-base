## Key Frameworks

**Costly Signaling**: Expensive or difficult actions that prove commitment and build trust

**Doorman Fallacy**: The tendency to dismiss ideas because they seem "too simple" — hidden value destruction in efficiency initiatives

**Transaction Utility**: The psychological value beyond the functional value — how the buying experience feels

**Choice Architecture**: Structuring decisions with decoys, contrast effects, and comparison sets

**Psychological Reframe**: Translating technical/operational problems into psychological/perceptual ones
