## Execution

### Step 1: 1/9/90 Market Mapping
Segment your market:
- **The 1%**: Extreme problems, pay anything (identify who)
- **The 9%**: Expensive problems, pay premium (your target)
- **The 90%**: Cheap problems, price-sensitive (avoid)

Provide: **Market Segmentation Map** with specific examples in each tier.

### Step 2: Stakes Calculation
For each tier, calculate what's at stake:
- Financial stakes (what they lose/gain)
- Career stakes (job security, advancement)
- Relationship stakes (team, family impact)
- Time stakes (opportunity cost)

Provide: **Stakes Analysis** by tier with dollar values.

### Step 3: Transformation Window Identification
Find moments when stakes spike:
- Promotions/role changes
- Funding rounds/exits
- Crises/emergencies
- Expansion phases
- Major presentations/negotiations

Provide: **5 Transformation Windows** with targeting strategy.

### Step 4: Premium Pricing Architecture
Calculate justified premium:
- Value-based pricing (10-30% of stakes)
- Competitor-relative positioning
- Psychological price points
- Payment structure options

Provide: **New Pricing Structure** with rationale.

### Step 5: Niche Messaging Transformation
Rewrite positioning for 9% audience:
- Problem-aware hooks for this tier
- Stakes-based value proposition
- Transformation promises

## Example Transformation

**Before**: 
- Service: Business Coaching
- Pricing: $2,500/month
- Clients: Anyone who'd pay
- Stakes: Generic "grow your business"

**After (9% Focus)**:
- Service: Revenue Acceleration for PE-backed Companies Pre-Exit
- Pricing: $15,000/month
- Clients: Founders with 18-24 month exit timeline
- Stakes: "$10-50M difference in exit valuation"

**Stakes Calculation**:
"If I help you add $3M in EBITDA before exit, at a 7x multiple, that's $21M in additional enterprise value. My $180K annual fee is less than 1% of the value created."
