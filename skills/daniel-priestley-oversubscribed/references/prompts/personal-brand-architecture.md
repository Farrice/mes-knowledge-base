## Execution

### Step 1: Susan Transformation
Transform generic positioning into specific authority:
- Take current title

- Add outcome specificity
- Add transformation language

**Before**: "HR Consultant"
**After**: "Hypergrowth People Architect for Series A Tech Companies"

Provide: **5 Transformed Title Options** ranked by impact.

### Step 2: 5-Part KPI Pitch
Design the complete Pitch-Publish-Product-Profile-Partnership architecture:

**Pitch**: Your 30-second, 2-minute, and 5-minute versions
**Publish**: Content strategy for authority
**Product**: Intellectual property you can sell
**Profile**: Bio, credentials, story arc
**Partnership**: Strategic alliance opportunities

Provide: **Complete 5-Part Framework** with specifics.

### Step 3: Brand Voice Design
Define how you communicate:
- Tone (authoritative vs. approachable)
- Style (formal vs. conversational)
- Vocabulary level (technical vs. accessible)
- Signature phrases
- Things you never say

Provide: **Brand Voice Guide** with examples.

### Step 4: 11/90 Visibility Plan
Design system for meeting the visibility threshold:
- 11 touchpoints per prospect in 90 days
- Channel mix for maximum exposure
- Content calendar structure
- Touchpoint mapping

Provide: **Visibility System** with specific tactics.

### Step 5: Differentiation Architecture
Establish what makes you the only choice:

- Your "only in the world" statement

Provide: **Differentiation Statement** with supporting proof.

1. Susan Transformation (5 options + winner)
2. 5-Part KPI Pitch (complete)
3. Brand Voice Guide
4. 11/90 Visibility System

## Success Metric

- Recognized as authority within 90 days
- 4x response rate on outreach
- 3-5x premium pricing accepted
- Inbound opportunities dominate

---

## Creative Latitude

The goal is to claim authority through positioning, not wait to earn it through credentials. This feels uncomfortable—that's correct. The discomfort indicates you're pushing past worker-bee positioning.

Brand should feel like you 18 months from now, not you today. Claim the identity you're growing into.

## Example Usage

**Input**: 
- Current: "Business Coach"
- Expertise: Operations systems, team management
- Industry: Professional services

**Susan Transformation**:
"Business Coach" → "Scale Operations Architect for $3-10M Professional Services Firms"

**5-Part Pitch (30 seconds)**:
"I help professional services firms stuck between $3-10M break through their growth ceiling without adding headcount. My clients typically add $2M in 12 months while working 10 fewer hours weekly. I do this through what I call the Invisible Operations System—a methodology I developed after scaling three firms past $15M."
