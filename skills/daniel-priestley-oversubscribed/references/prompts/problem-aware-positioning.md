## Execution

### Step 1: Frustration Excavation

- Deep frustrations (keep them up at 3am)

Provide: **10 Frustration Statements** in client's own language.

### Step 2: "Right Before They Search" Mapping

- What emotion spikes?
- What deadline approaches?

Provide: **3-5 Trigger Moments** with emotional state.

### Step 3: Problem-Aware Headline Suite
Transform solution-aware headlines into problem-aware alternatives:

**Solution-Aware (Bad)**: "We help businesses grow"
**Problem-Aware (Good)**: "Your CEO Wants Pipeline Numbers Monday"

Provide: **10 Problem-Aware Headlines** ranked by impact.

### Step 4: Content Pillar Transformation
Create problem-aware content angles for:
- Blog posts
- Social media

- Ad hooks

Provide: **25 Problem-Aware Content Hooks**.

### Step 5: Complete Messaging Overhaul
Rewrite:

## Creative Latitude

The goal is to enter the prospect's PRIVATE CONVERSATION—the thoughts they have at 3am, in the shower, on the commute. This isn't about being negative; it's about being RELEVANT.

Problem-aware messaging should feel like you're reading their mind, not criticizing them.
