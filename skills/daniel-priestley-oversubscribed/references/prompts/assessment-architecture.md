Provide: **5-7 Qualification Questions** with scoring.

### Step 4: Scoring Architecture

## Example Assessment Opening

**Question 1 (Problem Surface)**: "How many hours per week do you spend on tasks that someone less experienced could handle with proper training?"
- 0-2 hours: 1 point
- 3-5 hours: 3 points
- 6-10 hours: 5 points
- 10+ hours: 7 points

*Insight revealed*: Time trapped in low-leverage work = scaling bottleneck

**Results Insight**: "You're spending 6-10 hours weekly on tasks that should be delegated. At your billing rate, that's $2,400/week in lost opportunity—over $100K annually."
