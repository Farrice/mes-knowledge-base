## The 10 Priestley Truths

1. **Demand is manufactured, not found.** Stop looking for clients. Start creating wanting.
2. **Your capacity is a feature.** Scarcity creates value. Protect it fiercely.
3. **Value lives in the buyer's situation.** Price on their stakes, not your hours.
4. **Authority is claimed, not granted.** Position as KPI. Don't wait for permission.
5. **The business exists to serve your life.** If it's consuming you, the model is wrong.
6. **"With or without you" energy is magnetic.** Full pipeline creates abundance.
7. **Path of least resistance positions offers.** Make buying feel inevitable.
8. **Oversubscription is sustainable.** This is an operating model, not a tactic.
9. **Problems are bigger than solutions.** Speak to frustrations for endless demand.
10. **You're standing on a mountain.** Your "ordinary" expertise is extraordinary.
