# Seth Godin — Ideavirus Mastery

> Transform any idea, product, or service into a self-spreading ideavirus using the foundational principles that redefined marketing in the digital age.

## Overview

This skill captures Seth Godin's complete operating system for designing, launching, and profiting from ideas that spread themselves. Every modern growth hack, viral loop, and word-of-mouth strategy traces back to these principles.

**Expert**: Seth Godin — Marketing Visionary, Author of 20+ bestsellers, Marketing Hall of Fame inductee
**Domain**: Viral Marketing + Idea Propagation + Network Effects + Consumer Psychology
**Core Philosophy**: "The sooner you ask for money, the less you'll make." — Ideas must spread first, then capture value.

## Deployable Capabilities

| Capability | Description | Prompt |
|------------|-------------|--------|
| **Ideavirus Architecture** | Design any idea for viral spread with the 8-variable framework | [ideavirus-architect](references/prompts/ideavirus-architect.md) |
| **Sneezer Activation** | Identify and mobilize the people who spread ideas | [sneezer-activation-engine](references/prompts/sneezer-activation-engine.md) |
| **Smoothness Optimization** | Eliminate all friction from idea transmission | [smoothness-optimizer](references/prompts/smoothness-optimizer.md) |
| **Hive Domination** | Select and conquer specific market segments | [hive-domination-strategist](references/prompts/hive-domination-strategist.md) |
| **Vacuum Detection** | Spot opportunities where no dominant idea exists | [vacuum-detector](references/prompts/vacuum-detector.md) |
| **Monetization Timing** | Know exactly when to charge vs. give away | [monetization-timer](references/prompts/monetization-timer.md) |
| **Virusworthiness Engineering** | Make any boring idea worth spreading | [virusworthiness-engineer](references/prompts/virusworthiness-engineer.md) |

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
What's your current situation?
│
├─ "I have an idea but it's not spreading"
│   └─ Use: virusworthiness-engineer → ideavirus-architect
│
├─ "I don't know who will spread my idea"
│   └─ Use: sneezer-activation-engine → hive-domination-strategist
│
├─ "People like it but don't share it"
│   └─ Use: smoothness-optimizer
│
├─ "I'm looking for a market opportunity"
│   └─ Use: vacuum-detector → ideavirus-architect
│
├─ "I don't know when to monetize"
│   └─ Use: monetization-timer
│
└─ "I want to dominate a niche"
    └─ Use: hive-domination-strategist → sneezer-activation-engine
```

## Quick Start

**24-Hour Deployment**:
1. Run `virusworthiness-engineer` on your current idea — get honest remarkability score
2. Apply `ideavirus-architect` to engineer the 8 viral variables
3. Use `sneezer-activation-engine` to identify who will spread it
4. Deploy `smoothness-optimizer` to remove friction from sharing

**Key Framework — The 8 Viral Variables**:
- **Sneezers**: Who spreads it? (Powerful vs. Promiscuous)
- **Hive**: Which community adopts first?
- **Velocity**: How fast does it spread?
- **Vector**: What direction does it travel?
- **Medium**: Through what channels?
- **Smoothness**: How frictionless is sharing?
- **Persistence**: Does it stick?
- **Amplifier**: What increases its reach?
