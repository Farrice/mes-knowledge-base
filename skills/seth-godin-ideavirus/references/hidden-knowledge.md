# Hidden Knowledge — Seth Godin Ideavirus

## Tacit Knowledge 1: The Smoothest Idea Wins
The best idea doesn't win. The smoothest idea wins. A mediocre idea with zero friction beats a brilliant idea with any friction at all.

**Deploy**: Always optimize for shareability over quality. Perfect is the enemy of viral.

## Tacit Knowledge 2: Powerful vs. Promiscuous Sneezers
Powerful sneezers (experts, celebrities) spread for reputation—they won't risk endorsing bad ideas. Promiscuous sneezers (enthusiasts) spread for incentives—they'll share anything that benefits them.

**Deploy**: Target powerful sneezers with proof and social risk mitigation. Target promiscuous sneezers with incentive structures.

## Tacit Knowledge 3: Private → Public Conversion
Ideas first spread in private (DMs, conversations) before going public. The failure point is often the leap from private enthusiasm to public sharing.

**Deploy**: Create "private sharing first" pathways. Make forwarding feel intimate, not broadcast.

## Tacit Knowledge 4: Hive Domination Imperative
Dominate one hive completely before expanding. 80% share in one community beats 8% in ten communities.

**Deploy**: Choose the smallest viable hive and achieve tipping point there before any expansion.

## Tacit Knowledge 5: The Vacuum Rush
Ideas rush to fill empty mental space with near-zero resistance. Ideas fighting occupied space face exponential resistance.

**Deploy**: Find the vacuum first. Position ideas as "the first" not "the better."

## Tacit Knowledge 6: Monetization Destroys Velocity
Every monetization point creates friction. The sooner you charge, the slower it spreads, the smaller your total capture.

**Deploy**: Model the tradeoff: (spread × eventual capture) > (reduced spread × immediate capture)

## Tacit Knowledge 7: The Souvenir Separation
Separate the "virus" (what spreads for free) from the "souvenir" (what people pay for). The virus creates value; the souvenir captures it.

**Deploy**: Identify your virus/souvenir split. Protect viral elements from monetization.
