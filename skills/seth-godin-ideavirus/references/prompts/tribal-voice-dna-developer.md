4. **ELIMINATE** generic patterns to remove
5. **BUILD** rhythm blueprint (sentence and paragraph architecture)

## The Godin Insight

"Your voice is not found. It's developed through courage—the willingness to sound like yourself even when that feels risky."

## Performance Metrics

- Readers can identify your writing without a byline
- Tribe members feel "they get me"
- Generic becomes distinctive
- Writing becomes faster (less second-guessing)

## Example Usage

**Input**:
- SAMPLES: [3 blog posts, 2 LinkedIn articles]
- ADMIRED: Seth Godin, Maria Popova, Morgan Housel
- TRIBE: Thoughtful marketers tired of hype
- VALUES: Quality over quantity, slow over fast, substance over flash

**Distinctive Elements to Amplify**:
1. The double-take sentence (say something obvious, then reveal it's not)
2. Generous citations (giving credit builds trust)
3. Open questions (inviting thinking, not telling)
4. Specific over abstract (always concrete examples)
5. Permission-giving energy ("you don't have to...")
