# Implementation Pathway — Seth Godin Ideavirus

## 24-Hour Quickstart

**Hours 0-2**: Remarkability Audit
- Rate your idea 1-10 on "would I tell someone unprompted?"
- If below 7, brainstorm 3 ways to make it more remarkable
- Select one angle and commit

**Hours 2-4**: 8-Variable Diagnostic
- Score your idea on each of the 8 viral variables
- Identify the 2 weakest variables
- Draft improvement strategies for each

**Hours 4-6**: Sneezer Strategy
- List 10 potential powerful sneezers in your space
- List 3 communities with high promiscuous sneezer density
- Draft approach strategy for each type

**Hours 6-8**: Smoothness Audit
- Map the current share path (every click, every step)
- Count total friction points
- Reduce by at least 50%

## 7-Day Sprint

**Days 1-2**: Foundation
- Complete 8-variable audit + remarkability scoring
- Identify primary hive for domination
- Document sneezer strategy

**Days 3-4**: Smoothness Engineering
- Redesign share pathways
- Create share assets (copy, images, links)
- Test with 5 real users and measure friction

**Days 5-6**: Hive Entry
- Begin engagement in target hive
- Deliver value without any ask
- Identify specific powerful sneezers

**Day 7**: Launch Preparation
- Finalize viral loop design
- Set magic number tracking
- Prepare sneezer activation sequence

## 30-Day Transformation

**Week 1**: Foundation + Diagnostics
- Complete all assessments
- Redesign idea for maximum virusworthiness
- Build smoothness infrastructure

**Week 2**: Hive Domination
- Concentrated effort in single hive
- Begin tracking share metrics
- Activate first sneezer cohort

**Week 3**: Velocity Optimization
- Analyze what's spreading and what isn't
- Double down on working vectors
- Eliminate non-performing variablesVariables

**Week 4**: Scale + Monetization Prep
- If magic number >1.0: prepare expansion
- If magic number <1.0: diagnose and fix
- Design souvenir strategy for value capture
