# Genius Patterns — Seth Godin Ideavirus

## Pattern 1: The Spread-First Paradigm
**Execute**: Before any marketing activity, ask "how will people share this with each other?" not "how will I reach people?"
**Success Metric**: Every campaign has a documented viral loop before launch

## Pattern 2: The 8-Variable Engineering Framework
**Execute**: Audit any idea against: Sneezers, Hive, Velocity, Vector, Medium, Smoothness, Persistence, Amplifier. Score each 1-10.
**Success Metric**: Ideas score 7+ on at least 5 variables before launch

## Pattern 3: Vacuum Physics Applied to Marketing
**Execute**: Before entering a market, identify empty mental space. Ask "where is there NO dominant idea?"
**Success Metric**: Launched ideas face zero direct competition for attention

## Pattern 4: The Sneezer Hierarchy
**Execute**: Classify spreaders as Powerful (spread for reputation) or Promiscuous (spread for incentives). Different approach for each.
**Success Metric**: Sneezer strategy documents both types with tailored activation plans

## Pattern 5: Smoothness as Competitive Advantage
**Execute**: Count the steps to share. Reduce by 50%. Every friction point kills spread exponentially.
**Success Metric**: Share path is 3 clicks or less

## Pattern 6: The Monetization Paradox
**Execute**: Delay charging until the idea has achieved critical mass. Map monetization triggers to spread metrics.
**Success Metric**: Monetization begins only after viral coefficient exceeds 1.0

## Pattern 7: Virusworthiness Before Mechanics
**Execute**: Before any viral engineering, honestly rate remarkability 1-10. If below 7, fix the idea first.
**Success Metric**: Ideas pass "would I tell my friend about this?" test

## Pattern 8: The Magic Number Calculation
**Execute**: [People told] × [Conversion rate] must exceed 1.0 for viral growth. Calculate before launch.
**Success Metric**: Magic number tracked weekly; campaigns adjusted to maintain >1.0

## Pattern 9: Permission Asset Building
**Execute**: Every interaction should increase permission to communicate. Never interrupt; always be invited.
**Success Metric**: Email list and community grows organically without paid acquisition

## Pattern 10: The Fashion Moment Detection
**Execute**: Ideas spread fastest during transition moments. Identify when your market is ready to adopt something new.
**Success Metric**: Launch timing aligned with identified fashion windows
