   - Desire expressions (how they describe wants)
   - Internal dialogue reconstruction (3am thoughts)
   - Emotional frequency mapping (dominant/hidden/aspirational)

2. **Resonance Architecture Design**
   - Situation triggers ("that's exactly my life")
   - Language triggers ("that's exactly what I say")
   - Emotion triggers ("that's exactly how I feel")

3. **Insider Signal Bank**
   - Industry-specific references
   - Specific tools/platforms they use
