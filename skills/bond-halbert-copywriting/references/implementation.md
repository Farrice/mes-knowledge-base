# Bond Halbert - Implementation Pathways

Structured timelines for deploying Bond's methodologies at different intensities.

---

## 24-Hour Quick Deploy

**Objective**: Immediate improvement to existing copy using foundational techniques.

| Hour | Activity | Prompt |
|------|----------|--------|
| 0-1 | Apply Pee Test to one existing asset | p02-pee-test-editor.md |
| 1-2 | Convert 10+ static claims to present progressive | p03-present-progressive-converter.md |
| 2-3 | Rewrite bullets using Bullet Matrix | p01-bullet-matrix-engine.md |
| 3-4 | Restructure for Four Reader Types | p11-four-reader-types-architect.md |
| 4-6 | Apply invisible authority scan | p12-invisible-authority-builder.md |
| 6-8 | Write PS variants | p04-ps-formula-generator.md |

**Expected Outcome**: Measurably improved conversion on existing asset.

## 7-Day Sprint

**Objective**: Complete mastery of copy mechanics plus first campaign architecture.

### Days 1-2: Foundation Building
- 2 hours: Market language extraction (p14)
- 2 hours: Prospect immersion protocol (p10)
- 1 hour: Build resonance profile (p20)

### Days 3-4: Copy Mechanics Mastery
- Apply Pee Test to 3 existing assets (p02)
- Rewrite all bullets using Matrix (p01)
- Structure for four reader types (p11)
- Add invisible authority (p12)

### Days 5-6: Campaign Architecture
- Build first cold traffic conversion system (p16)
- Engineer instant relevance opening (p15)
- Pre-position all objections (p05)
- Create velocity funnel (p19)

### Day 7: Optimization & Documentation
- Apply What If closer to all fence-sitter points (p06)
- Write PS variants (p04)
- Document results, identify improvement areas

**Expected Outcome**: First complete cold traffic funnel deployed with optimized copy.

## 30-Day Transformation

**Objective**: Full arsenal deployment with compounding results.

### Week 1: Research & Foundation
- **Day 1-2**: Market language extraction (exhaustive) + prospect immersion
- **Day 3-4**: Build conversation hook library, test in real world
- **Day 5**: Apply all foundation techniques to existing assets
- **Day 6-7**: Document baseline metrics, identify optimization opportunities

### Week 2: Copy Mechanics Deep Dive
- **Day 8-10**: Master Bullet Matrix, apply to all benefit claims
- **Day 11-12**: Perfect objection pre-positioning system
- **Day 13-14**: Build invisible authority into all assets

### Week 3: Campaign Architecture
- **Day 15-17**: Build complete cold traffic conversion system
- **Day 18-19**: Engineer irresistible offer using 5-tier stack
- **Day 20-21**: Compress buying journey using velocity system

### Week 4: Cross-Domain & Scale
- **Day 22-23**: Deploy content multiplication matrix
- **Day 24-25**: Build authority narrative system
- **Day 26-27**: Launch omnipresent compound messaging
- **Day 28-30**: Measure, document, identify next wave priorities

**Expected Outcome**: Complete deployment of all 26 prompts with documented results across multiple assets and campaigns.

## Prompt Priority Order

For maximum impact, deploy prompts in this sequence:

1. **Essential Always**: p02 (Pee Test), p14 (Language), p11 (Four Types)
2. **Next Priority**: p01 (Bullets), p05 (Objections), p15 (Relevance)
3. **Campaign Level**: p16 (Cold Traffic), p17 (Offer), p19 (Velocity)
4. **Scale Phase**: p23 (Content Matrix), p26 (Omnipresent)
