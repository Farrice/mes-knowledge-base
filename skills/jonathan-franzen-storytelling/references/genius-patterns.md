## Pattern 1: The Comic Problem Genesis

**Surface**: Give characters problems.  
**Depth**: The best characters are defined by problems that are simultaneously small AND desperate. The man who can't sleep unless the house is locked exactly right. The woman who can't stand how her sister says "actually."

**Executable Behavior**: Start with the embarrassingly small thing that matters too much, then build the character outward from that specific itch.

## Pattern 2: Comic Distance as Truth Detector

**Surface**: Don't take your characters too seriously.  
**Depth**: When you can laugh at a character, you've found truth about them. Victim-positioned writing (where you're too close, too protective) produces sentimental, manipulative prose. Comic distance produces work that feels REAL.

**Executable Behavior**: If you can't find anything funny about your character's situation, you're too close. Step back until you can see the absurdity.

## Pattern 3: Shame-to-Comedy Conversion

**Surface**: Write about difficult things.  
**Depth**: The material we're most ashamed of—our ugly thoughts, embarrassing desires, petty grievances—becomes the BEST material once we can laugh at it. Shame piles on shame, making prose heavy and earnest. Comedy liberates.

**Executable Behavior**: Take your most shame-laden material. Find the ridiculous angle. The thing that would make you cringe becomes the thing that makes readers feel SEEN.

## Pattern 4: Minimal Detail Maximum Impact

**Surface**: Don't overwrite.  
**Depth**: A 500-page novel might have less than one page devoted to weather. Minor characters need only 2 sentences. The reader's imagination does the heavy lifting—you just need the RIGHT 2-3 details.

**Executable Behavior**: For any scene, identify the 3 details that do the most work. Cut everything else. Trust the reader.

## Pattern 5: Want-Collision Scene Architecture

**Surface**: Give characters conflicting goals.  
**Depth**: Every scene is powered by incompatible wants. Person A wants X. Person B wants Y. X and Y cannot both happen. The collision generates drama without forced "conflict."

**Executable Behavior**: Before writing any scene, articulate what each character desperately wants in that moment. Design the scene around the collision.

## Pattern 6: The Iron Bridge Page Building

**Surface**: Revise carefully.  
**Depth**: Every page must be FINISHED—publication-ready—before moving to the next. This prevents the "I'll fix it later" trap that produces drafts full of weak links.

**Executable Behavior**: Don't move on until the page behind you is as good as you can make it. The novel is built like an iron bridge, link by link.

## Pattern 7: Organic Plot Development

**Surface**: Don't over-outline.  
**Depth**: Know your destination, but discover the route. Sterile outlining produces predictable plots. Organic discovery—following character wants to their natural conclusions—produces surprising-yet-inevitable story.

**Executable Behavior**: Hold your destination loosely. Let characters' wants determine the route. If you're surprised, the reader will be too.
