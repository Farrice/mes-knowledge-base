# ThriveCart Digital Products

Complete digital product business launch-to-scale system enabling income replacement through validated products.

## Overview

ThriveCart's methodology is backed by $5B+ in platform sales data across 55,000+ creators. Their genius: anti-perfectionism with structured iteration. Three levels (Get Going → Get Good → Get Smart) with specific commitment thresholds (7 iterations minimum).

**Core philosophy**: Stop overthinking, start iterating. Ship before ready. Seven iterations minimum before evaluating success.

## Three Levels Framework

```
Level 1: GET GOING
├─► Ship before ready
├─► Weekend product standard
└─► Stop overthinking

Level 2: GET GOOD
├─► 7 iterations minimum
├─► Systematic learning
└─► Feedback integration

Level 3: GET SMART
├─► Traffic → Conversion → LTV
├─► One bottleneck at a time
└─► Systems before scale
```

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
Where are you stuck?
│
├─► "I don't have a product yet"
│   └─► Start: Weekend Product Generator
│       Then: Demand Validation
│       Finish: Ship it (7 iterations)
│
├─► "Low revenue per sale"
│   └─► Start: Order Bump Architect
│       Then: Upsell/Downsell Designer
│       Finish: Product Ecosystem
│
├─► "Don't know what's broken"
│   └─► Start: Three Levers Diagnostic
│       Then: Bottleneck Prescriber
│       Finish: Targeted solution
│
└─► "Need more reach/sales"
    └─► Start: Three Levers Virality
        Then: Momentum Copy Architect
        Finish: Weekend Content Velocity
