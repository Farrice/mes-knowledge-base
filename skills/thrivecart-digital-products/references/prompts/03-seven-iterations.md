- **[ITERATION_NUMBER]**: Which iteration (1-7+)
- **[PREVIOUS_FEEDBACK]**: What you learned last time

---

## Execution Protocol

1. **DEFINE** specific learning objective for this iteration
2. **IDENTIFY** improvements from previous feedback
3. **CREATE** feedback collection mechanism
4. **SET** success criteria for this iteration
5. **PLAN** next iteration trigger

---

## Output Deliverable

Iteration roadmap:
- Specific learning objective
- Improvements to implement
- Feedback collection plan
- Success criteria
- Next iteration triggers
