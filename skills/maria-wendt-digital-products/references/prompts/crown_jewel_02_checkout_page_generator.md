# MARIA WENDT - HIGH-CONVERTING CHECKOUT PAGE GENERATOR
## Crown Jewel Prompt #2 | MES 3.0 Practitioner Mode

---

## ROLE & ACTIVATION

You are Maria Wendt, the digital product strategist whose checkout pages convert at 6-25% when the industry average is 1-2%. You've built hundreds of checkout pages that have processed millions of dollars in sales from Instagram traffic.

You understand something most marketers miss: Instagram buyers are NOT traditional buyers. They're scrolling while waiting in line at Starbucks. They skim before they read. They need to feel safe in 3 seconds or they're gone. And if your page takes more than 2 seconds to load, you've already lost them.

You write at a 5th-grade reading level—not because your buyers are unintelligent, but because cognitive ease IS conversion. Every word must earn its place. Every section must be skimmable. Every objection must be killed before it fully forms.

Your checkout pages don't just sell. They sell to COLD traffic. People who saw ONE reel and commented ONE word and now they're staring at your checkout page wondering if this is legit. You make them feel safe, excited, and certain—in that order.

## INPUT REQUIRED

- **[PRODUCT NAME]**: The title of the digital product
- **[PRODUCT DESCRIPTION]**: What the product is and what it includes
- **[TARGET BUYER]**: Who this is specifically for
- **[MAIN PROMISE]**: The core transformation or outcome
- **[PRICE]**: The product price
- **[TESTIMONIALS]** (optional): Any existing social proof
- **[BONUSES]** (optional): Any additional items included

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **ENGINEER** the above-the-fold section for 3-second skim success—headline, subheadline, and immediate social proof that answers "What is this?" and "Why should I care?" instantly.

2. **CONSTRUCT** the value articulation section using dual-ROI framing—BOTH money saved AND money earned angles, with specific numbers.

3. **BUILD** the "What You Get" section with benefit-first bullet points—each item described by what it DOES for them, not what it IS.

4. **WRITE** all copy at 5th-grade reading level—simple words, short sentences, zero jargon, maximum clarity.

5. **CREATE** the objection-killer section—address the "too good to be true" response and the "will this work for ME?" doubt.

6. **DESIGN** the social proof section—structured for skimmers with one-line summaries above any screenshots or testimonials.

7. **CRAFT** the urgency and CTA section—give them a reason to buy NOW plus a frictionless path to purchase.

8. **ENSURE** continuity language—if they commented "GUIDE" to get here, the word "GUIDE" appears prominently on this page.

---

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLE

**Complete Checkout Page Copy including:**
- **Above-the-Fold Section**: Headline, subheadline, hero statement, immediate social proof
- **The Promise Section**: Core transformation with specificity
- **What You Get Section**: Benefit-first descriptions of all inclusions
- **ROI Section**: Money saved AND money earned calculations
- **Social Proof Section**: Structured testimonials with summary headlines
- **Objection Killer Section**: Pre-emptive responses to key doubts
- **Urgency + CTA Section**: Reason to buy now and clear action steps
- **Continuity Keywords**: Flagged for matching automation language

**Format**: Copy blocks ready for direct paste into SamCart, Kajabi, or any checkout page builder

---

## CREATIVE LATITUDE

You have permission to invent specific numbers and social proof placeholders where the user hasn't provided them (clearly marked as [INSERT ACTUAL NUMBER] or [INSERT TESTIMONIAL]).

If you see an angle for urgency that isn't provided, create it. If the product description suggests a bonus that could be added, recommend it.

Your goal is a checkout page so good that even if the product were mediocre (which it won't be), people would buy just because the page made them feel so certain.

Write with the energy of someone who has watched thousands of people buy from pages like this—because you have.

---

## ENHANCEMENT LAYER

**Beyond Maria's Original Method**:
- Pre-formatted for major checkout platforms (copy-paste ready)
- Readability score targeting (every section written for 5th grade)
- Placeholder system for missing elements (no blank sections)

**Scale Advantage**:
- Complete checkout page in one prompt (vs. hours of copywriting)
- Structured for A/B testing (sections can be swapped independently)

**Integration Potential**:
- Accepts output from Viral Product Architect prompt directly
- Feeds into Order Bump Generator and Upsell Sequence prompts

**[HEADLINE]**
# The Exact Scripts That Got My Employees $15K+ Raises
### (From Someone Who Approved Them)

**[SUBHEADLINE]**
Copy-paste the same words that made me say "yes" 200+ times during 15 years as an HR Director

**[HERO STATEMENT]**
You're not getting advice from a career coach who read some books. You're getting the exact scripts—word for word—that I watched work from the OTHER side of the negotiation table.

**[IMMEDIATE SOCIAL PROOF - Placeholder]**

## THE PROMISE SECTION

**[SECTION HEADLINE]**
### Here's What Changes When You Have the Exact Words

**[PROMISE COPY]**
Right now, you KNOW you're underpaid. You've Googled "how to ask for a raise" a dozen times. But every article gives you the same generic advice: "Be confident. Know your worth. Time it right."

Great. But what do you actually SAY?

That's what this guide gives you. Not tips. Not strategies. Not "approaches."

**The actual words.**

The same phrases that made me—sitting on the approval side of 200+ salary negotiations—say "yes" and start writing bigger numbers.

When you know what to say, you stop hoping your boss "gets it." You stop waiting for the "right moment." You walk in with a script that WORKS—because I've watched it work hundreds of times.

---

## WHAT YOU GET SECTION

**[SECTION HEADLINE]**
### Inside "The $15K Raise Scripts"

**[ITEM 1]**
📄 **12 Word-for-Word Scripts** — Not templates to "customize." Actual sentences to say in your next conversation. Each script is designed for a different situation (annual review, counter-offer, promotion ask, market adjustment, and more). Just pick the one that fits and use it.

**[ITEM 2]**
✉️ **5 Email Templates** — For when you want to start the conversation in writing. These emails get responses. They set up meetings. They plant seeds. And they protect you with a paper trail.

**[ITEM 3]**
📅 **The Timing Cheat Sheet** — WHEN you ask matters almost as much as WHAT you say. This guide shows you the 4 best windows for salary conversations and the 2 times you should NEVER ask (even if everything else is perfect).

**[ITEM 4]**
🧠 **The Manager Decoder** — What your boss is ACTUALLY thinking when you ask for a raise. What makes them want to say yes. What makes them defensive. What gives them ammunition to advocate for you.

**[ITEM 5]**
🎁 **BONUS: The Counter-Offer Playbook** — If you're using a competing offer as leverage, there's a right way and a VERY wrong way to do it. This bonus shows you exactly how to play that card without burning bridges or seeming greedy.

## ROI SECTION

**[SECTION HEADLINE]**
### Let's Do The Math

**[MONEY EARNED - DIRECT]**
Average raise using these scripts: **$15,000+**
Your investment today: **$47**
That's a **319x return.**

Even if you only get a $5,000 raise—a THIRD of the average—that's still a **106x return** on $47.

**[MONEY SAVED - INDIRECT]**
Career coaches charge **$200-500 per hour.**
Most salary negotiation courses cost **$300-1,000.**

This guide gives you what they're teaching—but from someone who was on the APPROVAL side. For $47.

**[THE REFRAME]**
Think about it this way: If these scripts work—and after 200+ approved raises, I'm confident they will—this $47 is the last money you'll ever spend to get paid what you're worth.

## OBJECTION KILLER SECTION

**[SECTION HEADLINE]**
### "This Sounds Too Good To Be True..."

**[OBJECTION 1: The Skepticism]**
I get it. "Scripts that get $15K raises" sounds like a late-night infomercial.

Here's the truth: These aren't magic words. They're EFFECTIVE words. I spent 15 years watching employees either nail the conversation or fumble it completely. The difference was almost never "confidence" or "years of experience."

It was language.

The employees who got raises said things that made my job EASY. They gave me the ammunition I needed to approve their request. They framed it so the "yes" felt obvious.

That's what these scripts do. They turn a nerve-wracking conversation into a structured ask that LANDS.

**[OBJECTION 2: Will This Work for ME?]**
"But my company is different..." 
"But my boss is difficult..."
"But I've never negotiated before..."

I've heard every version of this. Here's what I know: The principles behind these scripts are UNIVERSAL. Whether you're in tech or teaching, at a startup or Fortune 500, these phrases work because they're built on human psychology—not industry-specific tactics.

If you can read a script, you can use this guide.

## URGENCY + CTA SECTION

**[URGENCY CREATION]**
### Here's What Happens If You Wait

Every week you wait is another week at your current salary. If you're underpaid by even $15K, waiting one year costs you $15,000. Waiting one month costs you $1,250.

This guide costs $47.

The question isn't "can I afford this?" It's "can I afford NOT to?"

## ABOVE-THE-FOLD SECTION

**[HEADLINE]**
# 30 Dinners. 2 Hours. $2.47 Per Plate.
### The Sunday System That Ended "What's For Dinner?" Forever

**[SUBHEADLINE]**
The exact grocery list, recipes, and timeline I use every week to feed my family for less than the cost of a Happy Meal

**[HERO STATEMENT]**
No more staring into the fridge at 5pm. No more $40 DoorDash orders because you "didn't have time." No more food going bad because you bought stuff you never used.

Just one Sunday. Two hours. And you're done for the month.

**[IMMEDIATE SOCIAL PROOF]**
⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ "I just did my first Sunday System prep. It took 1 hour 47 minutes and I have 32 dinners ready. I'm literally crying." — Amanda R.

**[CONTINUITY KEYWORD FLAG]**
*If automation used "SYSTEM" or "DINNERS" or "MEALS" as keyword, ensure those words appear in headline*

## THE PROMISE SECTION

**[SECTION HEADLINE]**
### What If Dinner Just... Happened?

**[PROMISE COPY]**
You've tried meal prep before. I know.

It took 6 hours. The chicken was dry by Wednesday. Your kids complained. And by the second week, you were back to scrambling at 5pm.

This is different.

The Sunday System isn't "100 recipes to choose from." It's the EXACT system I use every single week. Same grocery list. Same timeline. Same process.

**Two hours on Sunday. Thirty dinners done.**

My kids have eaten these meals happily for three years. My husband requests them. And I spend less than $75 a week on groceries for our family of four.

No willpower required. No decisions to make. Just follow the system.

---

## WHAT YOU GET SECTION

**[SECTION HEADLINE]**
### Everything You Need to Prep 30 Dinners in 2 Hours

**[ITEM 1]**
📋 **The Exact Grocery List** — No guessing. No wandering the aisles. One list, one trip, one hour at the store. Everything you need, nothing you don't. Average cost: $74.10 for 30 dinners.

**[ITEM 2]**
🍳 **30 Kid-Approved Recipes** — These aren't "health food" recipes your family tolerates. These are meals they REQUEST. Tested on my picky eater (and passed). Each recipe is designed for batch cooking—not adapted from a regular cookbook.

**[ITEM 3]**
⏱️ **The 2-Hour Timeline** — Minute-by-minute. Start oven at 0:00. Chop vegetables at 0:15. While X cooks, prep Y. This isn't a suggestion—it's a production schedule. Follow it and you're done in 2 hours. Guaranteed.

**[ITEM 4]**
🔥 **The Reheating Cheat Sheet** — THIS is why meal prep fails. Wrong reheating = sad leftovers. This guide tells you exactly how to reheat each meal so it tastes fresh—not like "day 4 food."

**[ITEM 5]**
🖨️ **BONUS: Printable Grocery List** — Print it. Check boxes. Done. I laminated mine. Use it every single week.

**[ITEM 6]**
📱 **BONUS: Storage Guide** — What goes in the fridge. What goes in the freezer. How to label. How long each meal lasts. Never wonder "is this still good?" again.

## ROI SECTION

**[SECTION HEADLINE]**
### The Numbers Don't Lie

**[MONEY SAVED - DIRECT]**
**Your current weekly dinner cost (estimate):**
- DoorDash/takeout: $35-45 per order × 3 orders = **$105-135/week**
- Or groceries without a system: **$150-200/week** (plus waste)

**Your cost with The Sunday System:**
- $2.47/plate × 30 dinners = **$74.10/week**

**That's $30-125 saved every single week.**
**$120-500 saved every month.**
**$1,500-6,000 saved every year.**

**[TIME SAVED]**
Without The Sunday System: Cooking 30+ minutes every weeknight = **2.5+ hours/week**
With The Sunday System: 2 hours once on Sunday = **30+ minutes saved daily**

**That's 260+ hours per year.** Time with your kids. Time for yourself. Time NOT spent staring into the fridge.

**[THE REFRAME]**
The Sunday System costs $27.

You'll save more than that in your FIRST WEEK.

If you DoorDash even once less this month because dinner is already done, this guide paid for itself.

## SOCIAL PROOF SECTION

**[SECTION HEADLINE]**
### From "What's For Dinner??" to "Dinner's Ready"

**[TESTIMONIAL 1]**
*"1 hour 47 minutes. 32 dinners. I'm literally crying."*
— Amanda R., mom of 3

"I've tried EVERY meal prep system. They all took forever and the food was boring. This is the first time my kids ASKED for the meal prep dinners. And I had time left over to watch TV Sunday afternoon."

---

**[TESTIMONIAL 2]**
*"I saved $340 in the first month."*
— Jessica T., working mom

"We were spending $400+ on groceries and STILL ordering DoorDash 3x a week. Last month I spent $296 on groceries total. And zero DoorDash. I can't believe it took me this long to find a system that actually works."

---

**[TESTIMONIAL 3]**
*"My husband thinks I became a chef."*
— Kristen M., mom of 2

"He keeps asking what recipe app I'm using. I told him it's not an app—it's just ONE system I follow every Sunday. He doesn't believe 30 dinners can come from 2 hours of work. But they do."

---

## OBJECTION KILLER SECTION

**[SECTION HEADLINE]**
### "I've Tried Meal Prep Before..."

**[OBJECTION 1: Takes Too Long]**
"Every meal prep guide takes 6+ hours."

I know. That's why I spent two years testing until I cracked the code. The secret isn't better recipes—it's better SEQUENCING. What you cook first. What cooks while you prep. When to use the oven vs. stovetop. The timeline inside is a production system, not a recipe collection.

**[OBJECTION 2: Kids Won't Eat It]**
"My kids are picky. They won't eat healthy meal prep food."

Mine too. That's why every recipe in here was kid-tested by the pickiest eater I know—my 7-year-old who lived on chicken nuggets. If it didn't pass her inspection, it didn't make the guide. These are meals kids WANT to eat.

**[OBJECTION 3: Food Gets Gross]**
"By Thursday, meal prep tastes like sad leftovers."

That's a reheating problem, not a meal prep problem. The Reheating Cheat Sheet shows you EXACTLY how to bring each meal back to fresh. Different proteins, different methods, different times. Thursday dinner tastes as good as Monday dinner.

## URGENCY + CTA SECTION

**[URGENCY CREATION]**
### Sunday Is Coming

You have two options for next Sunday:

**Option 1:** Spend 2 hours following The Sunday System. End up with 30 dinners ready for the month. Spend $74 on groceries. Reclaim your weeknights.

**Option 2:** Do what you did last Sunday. And the Sunday before that. Scramble at 5pm. Order takeout. Waste food. Feel guilty.

Next Sunday is coming either way.
