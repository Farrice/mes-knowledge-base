## Execution Protocol

1. **IDENTIFY** improvement categories (performance, features, quality)
2. **PRIORITIZE** by client value and implementation effort
3. **PACKAGE** improvements as value additions
4. **COMMUNICATE** enhancements as proactive service
5. **MONETIZE** major upgrades appropriately
