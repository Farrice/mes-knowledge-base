# Brock Johnson — Genius Patterns

## Unconscious Mastery Behaviors

### 1. Share-Trigger Architecture
**Unconscious behavior:** Brock instinctively designs every piece of content around the question "Why would someone send this to a friend?" not "Why would someone like this?"
**Executable behavior:** Before creating any content, identify the specific social currency it provides the sharer — making them look smart, helpful, funny, or in-the-know.
**Deployment context:** Content ideation, hook development, CTA design
**Success metric:** Share-to-view ratio above 3%

### 2. The Relatability Reflex
**Unconscious behavior:** Brock defaults to universal micro-experiences rather than aspirational content — the "I thought I was the only one" moments that make audiences feel seen.
**Executable behavior:** Mine everyday frustrations, habits, and internal monologues that 80%+ of your audience experiences but nobody talks about publicly.
**Deployment context:** Relatable content type, hooks, story angles
**Success metric:** Comment sentiment dominated by "THIS" / "So true" / tagging friends

### 3. Pattern Interrupt Instinct
**Unconscious behavior:** Within the first 0.5 seconds, Brock disrupts the expected scroll pattern using visual, auditory, or conceptual disruption.
**Executable behavior:** Open with something that doesn't belong in the expected feed context — unexpected visuals, contradictory statements, mid-action entry points.
**Deployment context:** Reels hooks, carousel covers, story openers
**Success metric:** 3-second retention rate above 70%

### 4. Save-Worthy Density
**Unconscious behavior:** Brock structures educational content so dense with value that a single viewing isn't enough — creating the instinct to bookmark.
**Executable behavior:** Pack actionable frameworks, templates, or step-by-step processes into formats that require re-reference. Use numbered systems, checklists, or "save this for later" positioning.
**Deployment context:** Educational and saveable content types
**Success metric:** Save rate above 5%

### 5. Controversy Calibration
**Unconscious behavior:** Brock walks the exact line between "bold take" and "offensive" — creating disagreement that drives engagement without damaging brand.
**Executable behavior:** Challenge consensus beliefs with evidence-backed counterpoints. Target the belief, not the person. Give the dissenter a graceful exit ("I used to think this too").
**Deployment context:** Controversial content type, opinion pieces
**Success metric:** Comment threads with genuine debate (not hate)

### 6. Aspiration Gap Engineering
**Unconscious behavior:** Brock creates just enough distance between the audience's current state and the aspirational state to motivate — not discourage.
**Executable behavior:** Show the "2 steps ahead" version, not the "10 steps ahead" version. Make the audience feel "I could actually do this" not "I'll never get there."
**Deployment context:** Aspirational content type, transformation stories
**Success metric:** DM inquiries asking "how did you do this?"

### 7. Algorithm Transcendence
**Unconscious behavior:** Brock builds content around timeless human psychology rather than current algorithm trends — so content performs regardless of platform changes.
**Executable behavior:** Optimize for human sharing triggers (social currency, emotion, practical value, identity) rather than platform-specific hacks (hashtag strategies, posting times, etc.)
**Deployment context:** Long-term content strategy, platform-agnostic principles
**Success metric:** Content that performs across platforms and survives algorithm updates

## Hidden Knowledge

### 1. The Share Hierarchy
People share for 5 reasons, in this order of power: (1) Identity expression — "this is who I am", (2) Social currency — "look how smart/funny I am", (3) Practical value — "you need to see this", (4) Emotional resonance — "this made me feel something", (5) Tribal belonging — "we get this, they don't." Most creators only hit #3-4. Shareworthy content hits #1-2.

### 2. Metrics That Actually Matter
Vanity metrics (likes, followers) are noise. The only metrics that predict growth: shares per impression, saves per impression, profile visits per post. Shares = reach. Saves = depth. Profile visits = conversion intent. Everything else is ego.

### 3. The Format-Psychology Match
Each format triggers different psychological responses. Reels = pattern interrupt + emotional hook. Carousels = save trigger + teaching authority. Stories = intimacy + reciprocity. Static posts = controversy + identity. Match the format to the psychological response you want, not the content topic.

### 4. Content Compounding
One shareworthy piece > 30 mediocre pieces. Shareworthy content creates exponential reach through network effects. Each share exposes you to a new audience cluster that would never have found you through the algorithm alone. Quality doesn't just beat quantity — it makes quantity irrelevant.
