# Brock Johnson - Shareworthy Content Mastery

Beat the Instagram algorithm by making it irrelevant. Create content so good that humans do the distribution through shares—the highest-leverage engagement metric.

## Overview

**Core Philosophy**: Shares = human recommendation = algorithmic reward. The singular leverage point where human psychology and machine learning perfectly align. 1 share = 150-400 views (10-26x more than likes).

**Unique Value**: Direct intelligence from Instagram's Head (Adam Mosseri), systematic 5-category framework, and psychology-first approach that transcends algorithm changes.

## The 5 Shareworthy Content Types

| Type | Frequency | Share Trigger |
|------|-----------|---------------|
| **Motivational** | Daily | "I want my friend to feel inspired" |
| **Relatable** | Daily | "I thought I was the only one!" |
| **Timely/NAPs** | Weekly | "Did you see this?" |
| **Controversial** | Monthly | "This is what I believe too" |
| **Call-to-Arms** | Quarterly | "Help spread this message" |

## Quick Start

### 24-Hour Quickstart
1. Audit last 20 posts—how many would YOU share?
2. Create 1 motivational post (your recent experience, white text on black)
3. Create 1 relatable post (hyper-specific niche frustration)
4. Create 1 timely post (current trend + your niche angle)

### Ideal Content Ratio
- 40% your best-performing shareworthy type
- 30% motivational/relatable mix
- 20% timely/NAPs
- 10% controversial

## Hook Science System

| Rule | Guideline |
|------|-----------|
| Length | 5-8 words |
| Reading Level | 5th grade (instantly scannable) |
| Word Choice | Negative words when possible (stop, don't, avoid, never) |
| Test | Can you understand in 0.5 seconds? |
