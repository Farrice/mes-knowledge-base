## The 7 Copywriting Principles

Every piece of copy must pass these checks:

1. **The More Human, The Better** - Sounds spoken, not written
2. **The Rule of One** - One reader, one idea, one promise, one CTA
3. **Specificity Sells** - "$847/month" beats "hundreds of dollars"
4. **Agitate, Then Solve** - Enter the pain before offering the cure
5. **Benefits Over Features** - What it does FOR them
6. **Social Proof > Claims** - One specific testimonial beats ten promises
7. **Clear Over Clever** - Clarity for professionals, puns for amateurs
