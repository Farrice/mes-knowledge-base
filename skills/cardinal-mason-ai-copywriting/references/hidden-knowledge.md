# Cardinal Mason - Hidden Knowledge

5 tacit expertise points that separate amateurs from professionals.

## 1. Claude > ChatGPT for Copywriting
**The Truth**: Claude produces more natural-sounding writing, "listens better," and with memory features is the primary tool. ChatGPT relegated to research only.

**Deploy**: Default to Claude for all copywriting tasks. Use ChatGPT for research and fact-finding.

## 2. AI Humor Must Be Unintentional
**The Truth**: "AI is not funny" unless the humor is dry, subtle, and delivered as if the writer doesn't know they're being funny. Direct joke attempts always fail.

**Deploy**: Never prompt AI to "be funny." Instead: "Include dry, subtle humor that sounds like you don't realize you're being funny."

## 3. The 5-Question Context Gathering Hack
**The Truth**: Before writing first drafts, have AI ask YOU 5 questions to fill knowledge gaps. This surfaces what's missing from the brief.

**Deploy**: End every context prompt with: "Before you write your first draft, ask me five questions that will allow you to create high-quality, high-converting copy."

## 4. Webinar Email Sequences Need 20+ Emails
**The Truth**: For major launches, you need "20 emails, not three"—revealing the actual volume required for proper webinar promotion.

**Deploy**: Standard webinar sequence = 20+ emails across pre-registration, confirmation, reminder, show-up, and post-event phases.

## 5. Voice Notes Beat Text DMs 5-10x
**The Truth**: The entire outreach system is built on voice notes because they prove you're human and create parasocial connection instantly.

**Deploy**: Never send cold text DMs for high-ticket services. Voice notes only.
