# Hidden Knowledge

Tacit knowledge points that Seena Rez knows instinctively but rarely articulates.

## 1: The 3-Second Scroll Test

**Insight**: TikTok's algorithm rewards videos that stop scrolling within 3 seconds. Every hyperdopamine element serves this invisible threshold.

**Deploy**: Test every hook by asking: "Would this make ME pause at 11 PM while mindlessly scrolling?"

---

## 2: Sound as Dopamine Trigger

**Insight**: Hyperdopamine content requires AUDIO strangeness, not just visual. The glove stretching sound, the product click, the gasp—sound design is 40% of hook effectiveness.

**Deploy**: For every visual element, identify its corresponding audio trigger. Layer: visual strangeness + sound element + text overlay.

## 3: The 0.1% Math

**Insight**: "Just do 0.1% of what High Smile does." The market is so large that tiny percentage capture equals massive revenue. This abundance mindset removes psychological pressure.

**Deploy**: Stop competing against the whole market. Capture a tiny slice with excellent execution.

## 4: Speed = Legitimacy

**Insight**: Flashing authority signals quickly prevents conscious evaluation. Viewers assume rapid information = well-researched. Slow authority presentation invites skepticism.

**Deploy**: Never linger on a single proof element. Stack 5-7 authority signals in under 7 seconds.

---

## 5: Separation of Reach vs. Conversion

**Insight**: The hook's job is ONLY to stop scrolling. Conversion happens in the explanation section. Many creators fail by trying to sell in the hook.

**Deploy**: Keep hook purely attention-grabbing. Save all selling, benefits, and value for the explanation section.

---

## 6: The Variation Buffer

**Insight**: By creating 5 variations, you protect against the inherent randomness of viral content. You don't need to predict which hook wins—you just need ONE to hit. Statistical inevitability replaces guesswork.

**Deploy**: Never post single videos. Always post in variation sets of 5. Accept that most will underperform—that's the system working.

## 7: Caption Psychology

**Insight**: Yellow text on fast-moving video creates urgency and focus. It's not just readability—it's psychological priming for "important information."

**Deploy**: Use yellow for standard captions, white for key statements (solution reveal, value props, CTA), and red sparingly for pain points.
