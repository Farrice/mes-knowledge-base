# Seena Rez TikTok Commerce

Expert system for creating viral TikTok content that converts viewers into buyers at 5%+ rates. Based on Seena Rez who generated $1.8M in a single month from 2 viral videos. **23 prompts** spanning content creation, research, copywriting, and campaign orchestration.

## Core Methodology

**Hyperdopamine Content Architecture**: Create hooks that hijack multiple dopamine pathways simultaneously through visual strangeness, auditory stimulation, and emotional triggering—all within 3 seconds.

**PSAEP Sales Framework**: Structure every video in exact sequence—Problem Hook → Solution → Authority → Explanation → Product—the same formula used by High Smile ($1B+ revenue).
