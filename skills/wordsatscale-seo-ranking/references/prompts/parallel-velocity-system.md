## Execution

### Step 1: Session Assessment
Evaluate parameters:
- Content pieces to produce
- Time and realistic output
- Tool capabilities
- Quality requirements

### Step 2: Workflow Structure
Design parallel flow:
- Concurrent tasks (AI generation runs in parallel)
- Sequential tasks (review, publish)
- Minimize context-switching
- Build in quality checkpoints

### Step 3: Minute-by-Minute Plan
Create detailed schedule:
- Exact actions at each time mark
- Which article to focus on when
- Decision shortcuts for common situations
- Recovery protocols if something fails

### Step 4: Quality Control
Build verification system:
- Pre-publish checklist
- Common issues to watch
- Minimum gates that can't be skipped
