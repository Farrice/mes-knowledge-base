## Execution

### Step 1: SERP Analysis
Examine current page 1 results:
- How many dedicated review articles exist?
- What's the quality level? (thin vs comprehensive)
- What's the DA of ranking sites?
- How old is the content?

### Step 2: Competition Classification
Categorize opportunity:
- **TRUE VACUUM**: 0-1 dedicated reviews, or only outdated content
- **LOW COMPETITION**: 2-3 reviews but weak or old
- **MODERATE**: 4+ reviews covering the topic
- **SATURATED**: Quality content from high-DA sites

### Step 3: Ranking Probability Assessment
For TRUE VACUUM/LOW COMPETITION:
- What DA would realistically rank?
- How quickly could this rank?
- What content depth is needed?

### Step 4: Risk Identification
What could go wrong?
- Is product legitimate and lasting?
- Any signs competition is arriving soon?
- Monetization viability?

### Step 5: Go/No-Go Recommendation
Clear verdict with reasoning.
