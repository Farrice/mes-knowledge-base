# SooWei Goh — Consulting Leverage Mastery

> Build a consulting business that produces six-figure months working 4-5 hours daily using leverage architecture.

## Overview

This skill captures SooWei Goh's complete operating system for leverage arbitrage—understanding that the same 5 hours of work can produce $10K or $100K depending on WHAT you work on, not how hard you work.

**Expert**: SooWei Goh — Consulting Business Architect | $2M+/year profit | Clients scaling from $0→$137K/month
**Domain**: High-Ticket Consulting Scale + Founder Workflow Optimization + Personal Brand Leverage
**Core Philosophy**: "What gets you to 30K a month will not get you to 100K a month. It's a completely different skill set."

## Quick Start

**Key Framework — Leverage Hierarchy**:
- **One-to-One** (capped): Sales calls, client delivery, manual tasks
- **One-to-Few** (limited): Group coaching, team meetings
- **One-to-Infinity** (uncapped): Content, systems, brand building

**Manager vs. Leader Days**:
- **Manager Days**: Calls stacked 1pm-7pm, no gaps
- **Leader Days**: Zero calls, entire day for deep work
- **Sunday Reset**: No work, macro-level review only
