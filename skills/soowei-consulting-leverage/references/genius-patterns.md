# Genius Patterns — SooWei Consulting Leverage

## Pattern 1: The Leverage Hierarchy Principle
**Execute**: Before any task, ask: "Is this 1:1 (hands), 1:10 (shovel), or 1:1000 (bulldozer)?" Only execute bulldozer-level yourself.
**Success Metric**: Hours worked decreases while revenue increases

## Pattern 2: The Dopamine Detachment Protocol
