# Michael Bernoff Genius Patterns

## Pattern 1: Identity-First Sales Architecture
**What He Does:** Never tries to change what people believe about products—changes who they believe they ARE.

**Executable:** Before any feature/benefit discussion, insert a frame that repositions WHO the prospect is. "You're the kind of person who..." or "A guy like you..."

---

## Pattern 2: The Reset Frame
**What He Does:** In the first 9 words, erases whatever the prospect thought and installs his frame.

**Executable:** "If all you're looking for is [commodity version], you've got the wrong company. You should go back to Google."

**Result:** Prospect asks "Well, what DO you do then?" (frame surrendered)

---

## Pattern 3: Wrong Question Pattern Interrupt
**What He Does:** Doesn't answer controlling questions—challenges the question itself.

**Executable:** Look them in the eyes. Say: "That is the wrong question." Pause 1-2-3. "Can I tell you the right question?"

---

## Pattern 4: Inner Hero vs. Wounded Child
**What He Does:** Identifies two internal identities in everyone and speaks to the hero.

**Executable:** Never say "Good job." Say "Of course you did. That's why you're here." Speak to who they're becoming, not who they've been.

---

## Pattern 5: Certainty Implanting
**What He Does:** Pre-frames decision outcomes before presenting information.

**Executable:** "I'd love you to leave here confident that you know you're going to be wealthy. The real bonus isn't excitement—it's that you're going to leave decisive."

---

## Pattern 6: Biochemical Influence
**What He Does:** Triggers specific neurochemicals through word choices.

**Executable:**
- Serotonin (decisions): Decisive language, remove options, create clarity
- Oxytocin (trust): "Small family-based business," "work together," "member of your life"

---

## Pattern 7: The Script Frame
**What He Does:** Teaches that the only difference between successful and unsuccessful is the script describing reality.

**Executable:** "The only difference between you and me is the words I use to describe everything that happens in my life."

---

## Pattern 8: Reverse Polarity for A-Types
**What He Does:** Simultaneously compliments and challenges dominant personalities.

**Executable:** "You're a sharp guy. And because you're sharp, you're going to get a lot of this quickly. I just want to work with you to make certain you get the nuances..."

---

## Pattern 9: Analytical Respect Frame
**What He Does:** Validates need for data while repositioning as collaborative.

**Executable:** "Got it. Forgive me. You need data because you're one of those guys that does something really good with data. How about we work on this together?"

---

## Pattern 10: Status Raising Through Challenge
**What He Does:** Never enters inferior position. Raises status through strategic challenge.

**Executable:** Reject before they can reject you. "If all you want is X, we're not your guy." Enter "parent mode" when needed.

---

## Pattern 11: Likeable vs. Liked Distinction
**What He Does:** Focuses on being likeable while maintaining authority, not trying to be liked.

**Executable:** Never mirror obviously. Never use their name excessively. Be genuinely interested but not approval-seeking.

---

## Pattern 12: Three-Week Weird Acceptance
**What He Does:** Normalizes the awkward learning phase.

**Executable:** "Accept the three weeks of weird. On the other side of weird, you get wealthy."

---

## Pattern 13: Congruence Across All Contexts
**What He Does:** Same person on sales calls as at dinner—eliminates mode-switching.

**Executable:** Practice communication skills in ALL contexts. Never "get into sales mode."

---

## Pattern 14: Future Identity Installation
**What He Does:** Speaks to prospects as if they've already transformed.

**Executable:** Help them tell their future story now. "I went to an event one day and saw a guy speak... That's why I'm over here."
