# Michael Bernoff Hidden Knowledge

## The 3-Beat Pause After Pattern Interrupts
He doesn't just deliver pattern interrupts—he pauses for exactly 3 beats after, letting the disruption settle into the prospect's neurology before continuing. This pause is WHERE the identity shift happens.

## "Forgive Me" vs. "Sorry"
Never says "sorry"—says "forgive me." This maintains status while showing humility. "Sorry" is submissive. "Forgive me" is a request from an equal.

## The Soul-Look Through Technology
On Zoom or phone, he "looks through their soul"—maintaining intense presence that prospects feel even without physical proximity. This is held eye contact with the camera, not the screen.

## Identity Frames Are Referral Mechanisms
When you give prospects a unique identity frame ("my suit guy who picks outfits for date night"), you're also giving them language to refer you. The frame IS the referral script.

## Uncertainty = Objections
Core insight: objections aren't planned by prospects—they're triggered responses to uncertainty created by the salesperson. Eliminate uncertainty, eliminate objections.

## Parent Mode Activation
From Transactional Analysis: when prospects act like children seeking validation, enter "parent mode"—calm authority that provides structure. "Wrong question" is a parent-mode statement.

## The Serving Etymology
Sales comes from the Norse word "sal" meaning "to serve." Hold this etymological truth as operating frame—you're serving, not taking.
