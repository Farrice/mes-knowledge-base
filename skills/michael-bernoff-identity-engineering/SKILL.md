# Michael Bernoff Identity Engineering

Transform any communication by operating at the identity level—the deepest driver of human behavior.

## Overview

Michael Bernoff's methodology goes beyond traditional sales techniques to engineer identity transformations where prospects become people who naturally buy. These frameworks work because they address WHO people believe they are, not just what they believe about your product.

**Core Philosophy:** "The only difference between you and me is the words I use to describe everything that happens in my life."

## Deployable Capabilities

| Capability | Prompt | Use Case |
|------------|--------|----------|
| Reset Frame Opening | reset-frame.md | First 9 words of any sales conversation |
| Wrong Question Pattern | wrong-question.md | When A-types try to shortcut to price |
| A-Type Reframe | a-type-reframe.md | Handling dominant personalities |
| Analytical Respect Frame | analytical-respect.md | Working with data-driven prospects |
| Inner Hero Activation | inner-hero.md | Speaking to highest self |
| Certainty Implanting | certainty-implanting.md | Pre-framing decisions |
| Biochemical Influence | biochemical-influence.md | Dopamine/serotonin/oxytocin deployment |

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
START CONVERSATION
    │
    ├─→ Need to establish control? → Reset Frame
    │
    ├─→ Prospect asking price early? → Wrong Question Pattern
    │
    ├─→ Dealing with A-type personality?
    │     └─→ Yes → A-Type Reframe (challenge + compliment)
    │
    ├─→ Dealing with analytical/engineer?
    │     └─→ Yes → Analytical Respect Frame
    │
    ├─→ Prospect expressing doubt?
    │     └─→ Yes → Inner Hero Activation
    │
    ├─→ About to present/demo?
    │     └─→ Certainty Implanting first
    │
    └─→ Approaching close?
          └─→ Stack Biochemical Influence (oxytocin + serotonin)
```

## Quick Start

1. **Day 1**: Master the Reset Frame. Practice 20 times out loud. Deploy on 3 calls.
2. **Day 2**: Add Wrong Question pattern. Practice the 3-beat pause.
3. **Day 3**: Match frames to personality types encountered.
4. **Day 7**: Stack all frames in a single conversation.

## Key Principles

### The 3-Beat Pause
After any pattern interrupt, pause for exactly 3 seconds. This is WHERE the identity shift happens. Don't rush it.

### "Forgive Me" Not "Sorry"
Maintains status while showing humility. "Sorry" is submissive. "Forgive me" is a request from an equal.

### Congruence Across All Contexts
Practice these techniques everywhere—not just sales calls. The dinner table, casual conversations, everywhere. Never "get into sales mode."
