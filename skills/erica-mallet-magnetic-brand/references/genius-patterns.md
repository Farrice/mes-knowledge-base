# Erica Mallet Genius Patterns

## Pattern 1: Belief-Before-Content Architecture
**Execute**: Before creating any content, establish your belief system first. Build 3 core themes, each with 3 beliefs underneath (9 beliefs total). All content flows from this foundation.

**Success Metric**: Every piece of content maps to a specific belief. Audience can articulate what you believe.

---

## Pattern 2: The Enemy Effect
**Execute**: Identify a common enemy your audience shares. Name it explicitly. Position yourself as the one fighting against it. This creates tribal belonging faster than any positive positioning.

**Success Metric**: Audience uses your enemy language. They share content that attacks the enemy.

---

## Pattern 3: "Hide the Vegetable in the Cake"
**Execute**: Package beliefs as irresistible content formats. Never preach directly. The belief is the vegetable; the entertaining format is the cake.

**Success Metric**: Audience absorbs beliefs without feeling taught. They quote your beliefs as their own.

---

## Pattern 4: The 4 Psychological Loops (Zeigarnik Effect)
**Execute**: Create open loops that demand resolution:
- **Who Loop**: Reveal identity gradually
- **When Loop**: Create anticipation for timing
- **How Much Loop**: Tease quantities/results
- **Why Loop**: Hint at deeper motivations

**Success Metric**: Audience returns obsessively. Comments ask "what happened next?"

---

## Pattern 5: Expectation Violation Differentiation
**Execute**: Map your category's expectations. Identify which you violate. Double down on the violations—they ARE your differentiation.

**Success Metric**: Audience describes you by what you're NOT. "They're not like other [category]."

---

## Pattern 6: Connection Over Attention Priority
**Execute**: Optimize for DMs, replies, and referrals—not likes and follows. Create content that makes one person feel deeply understood, not content that reaches many shallowly.

**Success Metric**: High DM rate. Personal messages. Word-of-mouth referrals.

---

## Pattern 7: Through-Line Discovery
**Execute**: Look at your entire life—skills, experiences, failures, passions—and find the thread that connects them. This thread is your unreplicable positioning.

**Success Metric**: Your USP cannot be copied because it requires your specific life experience.

**Success Metric**: Audience can describe your voice using similar words.

---

## Pattern 10: The 5-Year Conversation Test

---

## Pattern 11: Cringe Mountain Navigation

---

## Pattern 14: Open Lane Detection

**Execute**: Notice moments when your beliefs clash with reality. These collisions are content opportunities—the friction creates insight.
