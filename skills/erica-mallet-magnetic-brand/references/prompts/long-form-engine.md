## Long-Form Structure

**Hook (0-2 min)**: Why watch this now
**Context (2-5 min)**: Frame the problem
**Promise (5-7 min)**: What they'll walk away with
**Framework (7-20 min)**: The core content
**Application (20-25 min)**: How to use it
**Transformation (25-28 min)**: Before/after vision
**Call (28-30 min)**: What to do next

## Execution

### Step 1: Promise Engineering
Define the contract:
- What specific outcome will they have?
- Why will this change them?
- What will they be able to do after?

### Step 2: Section Mapping
Build retention path:
- Each section earns the next
- Plant hooks for future sections
- Resolve loops strategically

### Step 3: Proof Architecture
Build credibility:
- Stories proving concepts
- Data supporting claims
- Examples demonstrating results

### Step 4: Retention Mechanics
Keep them watching:
- Pattern breaks every 2-3 minutes
- Open loops maintained
- Stakes escalation
- Curiosity refreshers

### Step 5: Transformation Design
Create before/after:
- Who they were before watching
- Who they are after
- What's now possible
