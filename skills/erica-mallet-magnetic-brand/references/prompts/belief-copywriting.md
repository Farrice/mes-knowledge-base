## Execution

### Step 1: Belief Integration
Embed belief throughout:
- Open with belief or its symptom
- Body demonstrates belief in action
- Close with belief confirmation

### Step 2: Belonging Language
Add tribal markers:
- "You" language that identifies insiders
- "We" language that creates inclusion
- "They" language that defines outsiders

### Step 3: Recognition Moments
Create "seen" experiences:
- Articulate thoughts they've had
- Name feelings they couldn't name
- Validate struggles they hide

### Step 4: Conversion Architecture
Structure for action:
- Problem (belief violation)
- Agitation (cost of wrong belief)
- Solution (your belief in action)
- CTA (join the tribe)
