## Execution

### Step 1: Theme Excavation
Identify 3 overarching themes that unite your work:
- Theme 1: The "what" you help with
- Theme 2: The "how" you approach it differently
- Theme 3: The deeper "why" behind everything

### Step 2: Belief Mining
For EACH theme, articulate 3 core beliefs (9 total):
- Beliefs should be "hot takes" that not everyone agrees with
- Each belief should identify those who DO agree as belonging
- Format: "[I believe] X because Y, unlike Z"

### Step 3: Enemy Identification
For each theme, name the enemy clearly:
- What false belief does your audience hold?
- What industry BS are you fighting?
- What competitor approach do you oppose?

### Step 4: Through-Line Discovery
Find the thread connecting your entire life:
- What skill stack creates your unique combination?
- What life experience makes you credible?
- What's your "only you could do this" factor?
