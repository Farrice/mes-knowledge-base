## Execution

### Step 1: Sequence Strategy
Map the journey:
- Where do they start?
- What do they need to believe?
- What action do we want?

### Step 2: Belief Threading
Embed beliefs throughout:
- Email 1: Belief #1 introduced
- Email 2: Belief #2 added
- Email 3: Belief #3 layered
- Later emails: Beliefs reinforced

### Step 3: Individual Email Craft
For each email:
- Subject line (curiosity/benefit)
- Hook (first sentence compelling)
- Body (one idea, conversational)
- CTA (one clear action)

### Step 4: Flow Optimization
Create reading momentum:
- Callbacks to previous emails
- Open loops resolved later
- Consistency in tone
- Building relationship
