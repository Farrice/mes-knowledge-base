## Execution

### Step 1: Hook Engineering
Create "stay" commitment:
- Bold promise
- What they'll learn
- What they'll have after
- Stakes if they leave

### Step 2: Content Architecture
Design transformation:
- Aha #1: Problem reframe
- Aha #2: Solution glimpse
- Aha #3: Path forward
- Each builds to offer logic

### Step 3: Bridge Engineering
Transition to offer:
- "But..." introduction
- Gap identification
- "What if..." proposition
- Natural lead-in

### Step 4: Offer Presentation
Make irresistible:
- Show what's included
- Stack the value
- Announce price with anchoring
- Bonus reveal
- Guarantee prominent

### Step 5: Close Engineering
Drive action:
- Summary of value
- Scarcity/urgency (authentic)
- Clear instruction
- Multiple CTAs
