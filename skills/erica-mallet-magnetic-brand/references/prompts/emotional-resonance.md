| **Surprise** | Expectation violation | Unexpected truth |
| **Relief** | Tension release | Resolution of built-up stress |

## Execution

### Step 1: Trigger Selection
Choose emotional targets:
- What emotion serves the content goal?
- What's audience's current state?
- What sequence creates desired arc?

### Step 2: Intensity Calibration
Set emotional dial:
- Mild: Gentle nudge
- Moderate: Clear feeling
- Intense: Profound impact

### Step 3: Sequence Design
Build emotional arc:
- Opening trigger (attention)
- Building triggers (engagement)
- Peak trigger (climax)
- Resolution trigger (satisfaction)

### Step 4: Trigger Stacking
Layer emotions effectively:
- Recognition → Validation → Hope (loyalty)
- Curiosity → Surprise → Validation (shareability)
- Fear → Indignation → Hope (action)
- Nostalgia → Belonging → Catharsis (bonding)
