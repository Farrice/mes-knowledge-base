## Execution

### Step 1: Belief-to-Visual Translation
Map each belief to visual language:
- Belief 1 → Color associated
- Belief 2 → Imagery type
- Belief 3 → Typography feeling
- Continue for all beliefs...

### Step 2: Enemy Visual Contrast
Define what enemy looks like:
- Enemy colors (avoid or contrast)
- Enemy imagery (do opposite)
- Enemy typography (differentiate)
- Enemy aesthetic (consciously violate)

### Step 3: Color System Development
Build palette from beliefs:
- Primary color (main belief)
- Secondary color (contrast/energy)
- Neutral tones (accessibility)
- Accent (calls to action)
- Emotional rationale for each

### Step 4: Typography System
Select fonts from belief expression:
- Headlines (bold belief statements)
- Body (readable belief exploration)
- Accent (personality expression)
- Rationale (why each font)

### Step 5: Photography/Imagery Direction
Define image style:
- Subject matter guidelines
- Mood and lighting
- Color treatment
- Composition style
- What to never show

### Step 6: Platform Adaptation
Customize for each platform:
- Instagram: Grid aesthetic, story style
- LinkedIn: Professional adaptation
- Twitter: Profile coherence
- YouTube: Thumbnail style, intro style
