### Step 1: Signal Detection
Identify what's trending:
- Breaking news in niche
- Cultural moments
- Industry drama
- New tool/product launches

- Which belief does this violate?
- Which belief offers perspective?
- What would your tribe say?

### Step 3: Bridge Construction
Build the connection:
- Signal + Belief = Your Take
- "Here's what everyone's missing..."
- "This proves what I've been saying..."
- "While everyone is focused on X, the real issue is Y..."

### Step 4: Angle Selection
Choose your approach:
**Commentary**: Your reaction/observation
**Prediction**: What happens next
**Contrarian**: Why the common take is wrong
**Deeper Truth**: The underlying principle

### Step 5: Timing Optimization
Speed vs. depth decision:
- Hot trend: Publish fast, add depth later
- Slow burn: Take time for unique angle
- Recurring theme: Build series over time
