# Genius Patterns: Oren TASTE Development

## Pattern 1: The Demystification Frame
**What Oren does**: Opens by dismantling the "taste is innate" myth, repositioning it as "easy" and "completely learned"—removing psychological barriers.

**Executable Behavior**: When introducing any complex skill, lead with demystification. Declare it learnable. Remove the mystique that creates intimidation paralysis.

---

## Pattern 2: The Tech-Discovers-Taste Zeitgeist Hook
**What Oren does**: Anchors "why now" by pointing to tech's sudden valuation of taste (Claude's positioning, Quarter's visuals), making the skill urgently relevant.

**Executable Behavior**: Connect any skill development to current market demand. Show who is paying premium for this capability NOW.

---

## Pattern 3: The Two-Level Foundation Architecture
**What Oren does**: Separates "human perception fundamentals" (rule of thirds, color theory) from "historical knowledge base" (design periods, classic albums)—two distinct learning tracks that compound.

**Executable Behavior**: When teaching any domain, identify (1) universal perceptual/cognitive laws and (2) domain-specific canon. Teach both tracks.

---

## Pattern 4: The Weekly Practice Prescription
**What Oren does**: Specifies "once a week, do one thing from one of those categories"—precise, sustainable practice rhythm that compounds without overwhelm.

**Executable Behavior**: Convert vague advice into specific frequency prescriptions. Weekly is the sweet spot for lifestyle-integrated skill building.

---

## Pattern 5: The Dual-Question Framework
**What Oren does**: Teaches exact questions when engaging with anything:
1. "Why was this appreciated? Why do people think it's a classic?"
2. "Do YOU appreciate it? Do YOU agree? Why or why not?"

**Executable Behavior**: Provide specific internal dialogue script for skill development.

---

## Pattern 6: The CEV Critique Matrix
**What Oren does**: Creates universal evaluation framework—Composition, Effectivity, Vibes—applicable to quarterzip jackets, music, literature, anything.

**Three Lenses**:
- **Composition**: Objective quality (is it well-made?)
- **Effectivity**: Functional success (does it work?)
- **Vibes**: Intangible resonance (does it feel right?)

---

## Pattern 7: The Knowing-Acting Gap Diagnosis
**What Oren does**: Explicitly names the gap between knowing the right choice and making it—"there's a big difference between knowing you should do it and acting on it."

**Executable Behavior**: When teaching behavioral skills, explicitly address the knowing-doing gap.

---

## Pattern 8: The Thrift Store Taste Test
**What Oren does**: Creates exercise removing money/brand as crutches—"Can you put together a complete outfit that looks good from chaos, without buying the answer?"

**Executable Behavior**: Design exercises that strip external validators and test pure skill.

---

## Pattern 9: The Life-Decision Integration
**What Oren does**: Elevates taste from aesthetic preference to decision architecture—every choice from "goods in your house to clothes to what you eat to topics you discuss" becomes taste exercise.

**Executable Behavior**: Connect any skill to life-wide application.

---

## Pattern 10: The Stakes-Based Mastery Escalation
**What Oren does**: Introduces social stakes—"Real taste has stakes... you need to put your opinions out there for others to judge."

**Executable Behavior**: Design progression adding social accountability: Private practice → public declaration → contested defense.

---

## Pattern 11: The Discourse Upgrade Frame
**What Oren does**: Positions taste conversations as superior discourse—"talking about ideas instead of other people or about other events."

**Executable Behavior**: Frame skill development as social capital upgrade.

---

## Pattern 12: The Immersive Experience Protocol
**What Oren does**: Describes deliberate cultural immersion—"in Italy... I want to only listen to the music that was popular then in Italy."

**Executable Behavior**: Convert passive experiences into active learning protocols.

---

## Pattern 13: The Progression Patience Frame
**What Oren does**: Bookends with "this is a lifelong experience" and "can start whether you're 50 or 12"—removing urgency anxiety while maintaining momentum.

**Executable Behavior**: Frame mastery as ongoing journey while making starting accessible.

---

## Pattern 14: The Care Thesis
**What Oren does**: Concludes with "the important part is you think about it critically and can articulate it and that you care"—making care itself the core virtue.

**Executable Behavior**: Position genuine care as the differentiator.

## Hidden Knowledge

### The Four-Domain Canon
Specific canon: Meggs' History of Graphic Design, Tschichold's New Typography, Swiss poster design, Art Nouveau → Art Deco → Bauhaus → Swiss Design → Memphis Movement.

### Quality-Quantity Tradeoff
Core principle: Fewer, better, longer-lasting items over more, cheaper, faster-cycling items.

### Research-Before-Purchase Protocol
Tasteful people don't buy immediately. They research obsessively, consult networks, treat every significant purchase as learning opportunity.

### The Label-Stripping Test
True taste evaluates quality with brand and price tags removed. Most "taste" is actually brand recognition.
