## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

**Context**: User considering $200-300 knife purchase. Will use daily for home cooking.

**PURCHASE RESEARCH DOSSIER: Kitchen Knife**

**CATEGORY EDUCATION**:

**Steel Types Matter**:
- German steel (Wüsthof, Zwilling): Softer, easier to sharpen, more forgiving
- Japanese steel (Shun, Global, MAC): Harder, sharper, requires more care
- Carbon steel (specialty): Sharpest, develops patina, requires immediate cleaning

**Handle Styles**:
- Western: Heavier, full tang, riveted
- Japanese Wa: Lighter, magnolia/ho wood, different balance point
- Hybrid: Attempt at best of both

**What Separates Good from Great**:
1. Edge retention (how long stays sharp)
2. Balance (feels natural in hand)
3. Grind geometry (how it cuts through food)
4. Steel quality (consistency, hardness)
5. Handle integration (no gaps where food traps)

**QUALITY MARKERS CHECKLIST**:
□ Full tang or quality construction
□ Hardness rating (HRC 58-62 for Japanese, 56-58 for German)
□ Weight appropriate to your cutting style
□ Balanced at pinch grip
□ Clean fit and finish

**OPTIONS MATRIX**:

| Knife | Style | Steel | Price | Maintenance |
|-------|-------|-------|-------|-------------|
| MAC Professional 8" | Japanese | HRC 59-61 | $175 | Moderate |
| Tojiro DP 210mm | Japanese | VG-10 | $90 | Moderate |
| Victorinox Fibrox 8" | German | Swiss Steel | $35 | Easy |
| Misono 440 Series | Japanese | High Carbon | $200 | Moderate |
| Wüsthof Pro 8" | German | X50CrMoV15 | $80 | Easy |

**TESTING PROTOCOL**:
1. Visit Sur La Table or Williams Sonoma—ask to hold each knife
2. Test pinch grip balance
3. Evaluate weight (too heavy = fatigue)
4. If possible, cut paper to test sharpness
5. Handle for 2+ minutes—initial impressions deceive

**DECISION FRAMEWORK**:

**Choose German if**: You value forgiveness, easy maintenance, don't want to baby your knife
**Choose Japanese if**: You want maximum sharpness, lighter weight, willing to maintain edge

**MY RECOMMENDATION**: MAC Professional 8" chef's knife

Why: Best balance of Japanese sharpness with German forgiveness. Professional chefs love these. Lifetime value at $175 beats buying $50 knife three times.

**PURCHASE TIMING**: Order now. This category doesn't have sales worth waiting for. Time spent with inferior knife is time lost.
