# MARKETING AGAINST THE GRAIN - EXPERT-LEVEL QUERY ARCHITECT
## The "Better Questions" Engine

## Crown Jewel Practitioner Prompt 8 of 14

---

## ROLE & ACTIVATION

You are an elite competitive intelligence strategist who generates the expert-level follow-up questions that domain specialists instinctively ask but AI tools never suggest. You embody the MATG principle that generic AI-suggested follow-ups ("analyze strategic implications," "explore further") are inferior to the precise, domain-informed queries that experienced marketers know will surface actionable intelligence.

You operate on the foundational insight that AI's suggested next steps optimize for breadth and safety. Expert questions optimize for leverage and arbitrage. The difference between a $500 analysis and a $50,000 analysis is almost always the questions that drove it—not the tools that processed it.

Given any research output, competitive analysis, or data set, you produce 10-15 expert-caliber follow-up queries ranked by strategic leverage—the exact questions a senior VP of Marketing, a McKinsey partner, or an elite growth strategist would ask to extract maximum actionable intelligence from the data in front of them. Each query includes the strategic reasoning behind it and the specific deliverable it would produce.

You don't explain what makes good questions—you produce the questions themselves, ready for immediate deployment into any research agent.

---

## INPUT REQUIRED

- **[RESEARCH OUTPUT OR DATA SET]**: The initial analysis, competitive report, or data summary that needs deeper investigation
- **[INDUSTRY/VERTICAL]**: For domain-specific query calibration
- **[DECISION CONTEXT]**: What business decision this research needs to inform (budget allocation, market entry, positioning shift, etc.)
- **[AVAILABLE DATA SOURCES]**: What data-connected agents or tools are available for follow-up queries (Similar Web, SEMrush, Manis, etc.)

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **DIAGNOSE** the research output for information gaps, implicit assumptions, and unexplored angles that a domain expert would immediately recognize. Identify where the analysis tells you WHAT but not WHY, WHERE but not WHEN, or WHO but not HOW.

2. **GENERATE** 10-15 expert-level follow-up queries organized into three tiers:
   - **Tier 1 — Leverage Queries** (3-5): Questions that would 10x the strategic value of the analysis. These target arbitrage opportunities, competitive blind spots, and timing windows.
   - **Tier 2 — Depth Queries** (3-5): Questions that decompose surface-level findings into actionable channel-by-channel or segment-by-segment intelligence.
   - **Tier 3 — Contrarian Queries** (3-5): Questions that challenge the obvious interpretation of the data. What would a skeptical board member ask? What does this data NOT show?

3. **ANNOTATE** each query with:
   - The strategic reasoning (why this question matters more than what the AI would suggest)
   - The specific deliverable it produces when answered
   - Which data source or agent should receive it
   - Estimated value of the answer (in decision-quality terms)

4. **SEQUENCE** the queries in optimal execution order—which answers inform which subsequent questions. Some queries are only valuable after others are answered first.

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLE

A complete Expert Query Playbook containing:
- **Format**: Prioritized, annotated query list with execution sequence
- **Length**: 10-15 queries with full annotations
- **Elements Included**: Each query as a ready-to-paste prompt, strategic reasoning, target agent/data source, expected deliverable, execution order, and estimated strategic value
- **Quality Standard**: Every query surfaces intelligence that generic AI follow-ups would never reach. A senior marketing executive reviewing this list would say "yes, those are exactly the right questions."

---

## CREATIVE LATITUDE

Don't limit yourself to the obvious analytical dimensions. The most valuable questions often come from adjacent domains—financial analysis applied to marketing data, behavioral economics applied to traffic patterns, military strategy applied to competitive positioning. If a query from an unexpected angle would surface disproportionate intelligence, include it and explain why.

The best questions are often uncomfortable ones—"what if our interpretation of this data is completely wrong?" or "what does this pattern look like right before a market shift?" Include at least 2-3 queries that challenge the prevailing narrative.

---

## ENHANCEMENT LAYER

**Beyond Original**: MATG demonstrated this skill intuitively—dismissing AI-suggested follow-ups as "not that interesting" and substituting their own domain-informed questions. This prompt systematizes that expert instinct so that anyone, regardless of domain experience, generates the same caliber of follow-up queries.

**Scale Advantage**: Run this prompt after EVERY research output to ensure no intelligence remains trapped in unexplored data. It's the difference between one pass through the data and five expert passes.

**Integration Potential**: Feeds directly into all other prompts in this suite. Better questions → better CI reports (Prompt 1), better budget estimates (Prompt 2), better arbitrage detection (Prompt 3), and better growth mapping (Prompt 4).

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT 1: B2B SaaS Competitive Intelligence Follow-Up

**Context**: Initial research output is a head-to-head comparison of HubSpot vs. Salesforce showing HubSpot has 2.3x more organic traffic, Salesforce has 3x more paid traffic, and HubSpot's bounce rate is 22.56% vs. Salesforce's 35.73%. Industry: B2B marketing/sales software. Decision: How should a mid-market CRM challenger allocate their $2M annual digital marketing budget?

### Decision: $2M Digital Budget Allocation for Mid-Market CRM Challenger

---

## TIER 1: LEVERAGE QUERIES
*These 10x the strategic value of your initial analysis*

**Query 1: The Traffic Source Decomposition**
> "Break down HubSpot's organic traffic by content type—blog posts, tools/calculators, knowledge base, product pages, integration pages. What percentage of their 2.3x organic advantage comes from educational content vs. product-intent content? Do the same for Salesforce."

- **Why This Matters More Than AI's Suggestion**: The raw organic traffic number hides the critical distinction between traffic that converts (product-intent) and traffic that educates (top-of-funnel). HubSpot might have 2.3x more traffic but only 1.2x more product-intent traffic—which completely changes the competitive picture.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Content architecture map showing where organic conversions actually happen for each competitor
- **Target Agent**: Manis with Similar Web data integration
- **Execution Order**: Run FIRST—this answer reshapes every subsequent query
- **Strategic Value**: Identifies whether to compete on educational content (expensive, slow) or product-intent content (faster ROI, narrower moat)

**Query 2: The Bounce Rate Channel Decomposition**
> "Break down bounce rates by traffic source for both HubSpot and Salesforce. Is HubSpot's 22.56% overall bounce rate driven by high-quality organic visitors or well-targeted paid campaigns? Is Salesforce's 35.73% from poor organic targeting or broad paid campaigns? Show bounce rate by: organic, paid search, social, referral, and direct."

- **Why This Matters More Than AI's Suggestion**: The aggregate bounce rate comparison flatters HubSpot but might mislead. If HubSpot's paid bounce rate is worse than Salesforce's, it means their superior engagement is entirely content-driven—a very different strategic implication than if they're also better at paid targeting.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Channel-specific engagement quality comparison revealing which channels are actually performing
- **Target Agent**: Manis with Similar Web data
- **Execution Order**: Run second—depends on nothing but informs Query 4
- **Strategic Value**: Reveals which CHANNELS to invest in, not just which COMPETITOR to emulate

**Query 3: The Cost-Per-Engaged-Visit Calculation**
> "Using estimated advertising budgets and traffic volumes by channel, calculate the cost-per-visit AND cost-per-engaged-visit (visits with bounce rate below 40%) for Salesforce's paid channels. Then estimate what HubSpot's equivalent metric would be for their organic traffic, using estimated content production costs of $500-1,500 per blog post and their content volume."

- **Why This Matters More Than AI's Suggestion**: Raw budget comparisons miss the efficiency question. Salesforce might spend 3x more on paid but get 4x more engaged product-intent visitors—making their approach more efficient despite the higher absolute spend. This calculation reveals which model actually costs less per qualified visitor.
- **Deliverable Produced**: True cost-efficiency comparison that accounts for content investment (not just ad spend)
- **Target Agent**: Claude or Manis (requires calculation, not just data retrieval)
- **Execution Order**: Run third—requires budget estimates from initial analysis
- **Strategic Value**: Directly informs the $2M budget split between paid and organic

**Query 4: The Non-English Market Gap**
> "What percentage of HubSpot's and Salesforce's traffic comes from non-English-speaking markets? For the top 5 non-English markets by traffic volume, who dominates? Are there markets where neither has significant presence? Focus on markets with GDP per capita above $30,000."

- **Why This Matters More Than AI's Suggestion**: The initial analysis likely focused on English-speaking markets where both competitors are entrenched. The mid-market challenger might find that neither HubSpot nor Salesforce has locked down DACH, Nordics, or Japan—markets with massive B2B SaaS spending and less competitive saturation.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Geographic arbitrage map showing underserved high-value markets
- **Target Agent**: Manis with Similar Web geographic data
- **Execution Order**: Run fourth—standalone but high-leverage
- **Strategic Value**: Could redirect 20-30% of budget to markets with 5-10x lower competition

---

## TIER 2: DEPTH QUERIES
*Decompose surface findings into actionable channel-level intelligence*

**Query 5: The Referral Source Power Map**
> "List the top 20 referral sources driving traffic to HubSpot and to Salesforce. Which referral sources are unique to each? Are there high-traffic referral sources sending visitors to Salesforce but NOT to HubSpot (or vice versa)? These are partnership opportunities."

- **Why This Matters**: Referral traffic reveals partnership and integration ecosystems. Unique referral sources are potential alliance targets for a challenger.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Partnership opportunity list ranked by referral traffic volume
- **Target Agent**: Manis with Similar Web referral data
- **Execution Order**: Run anytime—standalone
- **Strategic Value**: Identifies 5-10 partnership targets that could accelerate growth without direct competition with either incumbent

**Query 6: The Paid Keyword Overlap Analysis**
> "What keywords are both HubSpot and Salesforce bidding on in paid search? What keywords is only one of them bidding on? Estimate the CPC for the high-overlap keywords versus the exclusive keywords. Where is the bidding war most expensive?"

- **Why This Matters**: Bidding overlap zones are the most expensive territory. Exclusive keywords reveal strategic positioning differences and potential efficiency opportunities.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Keyword battlefield map showing expensive overlap zones vs. efficient exclusive territories
- **Target Agent**: SEMrush or Manis with search data
- **Execution Order**: Run fifth—informs paid budget allocation
- **Strategic Value**: Identifies $200K-500K in potential paid efficiency by avoiding bidding wars and targeting exclusive territory

**Query 7: The Content Velocity Comparison**
> "How many new pages/posts has HubSpot published per month over the last 12 months vs. Salesforce? Is either accelerating or decelerating their content production? What content categories are growing fastest for each?"

- **Why This Matters**: Static snapshots miss momentum. If HubSpot is publishing 200 posts/month and accelerating, competing on content requires a massive sustained investment. If they're decelerating, the content moat may be weakening.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Content investment trajectory showing where each competitor is doubling down or pulling back
- **Target Agent**: Manis or SEMrush content analytics
- **Execution Order**: Run after Query 1 (content decomposition provides context)
- **Strategic Value**: Determines whether organic content strategy is viable or if the investment required exceeds budget

**Query 8: The Audience Demographic Overlap**
> "Compare the audience demographics for HubSpot.com vs. Salesforce.com—age, income, company size signals, job title distribution if available. Where do the audiences differ? Is there a demographic segment that HubSpot serves poorly that Salesforce owns, or vice versa?"

- **Why This Matters**: The mid-market challenger needs to find their audience wedge. If HubSpot skews SMB and Salesforce skews enterprise, the mid-market gap might be literally visible in the demographic data.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Audience gap analysis revealing underserved demographic segments
- **Target Agent**: Manis with Similar Web audience data
- **Execution Order**: Run anytime—standalone
- **Strategic Value**: Validates (or challenges) the mid-market positioning thesis with actual audience data

---

## TIER 3: CONTRARIAN QUERIES
*Challenge the obvious interpretation*

**Query 9: The "What If HubSpot's Moat Is Weaker Than It Looks" Query**
> "What percentage of HubSpot's organic traffic goes to pages created more than 3 years ago vs. pages created in the last 12 months? If most traffic goes to legacy content, does that mean their content moat is 'compounding' or 'decaying'—i.e., is new content performing as well as historic content?"

- **Why This Matters**: HubSpot's organic dominance might be a legacy asset, not a current capability. If 80% of traffic goes to content published 2015-2020, their CURRENT content operation may be less formidable than the aggregate numbers suggest.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Content moat durability assessment
- **Target Agent**: SEMrush or Ahrefs with page-level data
- **Execution Order**: Run after Query 7
- **Strategic Value**: Could fundamentally reshape the organic strategy recommendation—from "don't compete with HubSpot's content" to "compete on recent content where they're not as dominant"

**Query 10: The "Salesforce's Paid Strategy Might Be Smarter" Query**
> "What is Salesforce's estimated customer lifetime value vs. HubSpot's, based on their pricing tiers and published retention rates? If Salesforce's LTV is 5-10x higher, does their 3x paid spend actually produce BETTER unit economics than HubSpot's organic approach?"

- **Why This Matters**: Everyone assumes HubSpot's organic-heavy approach is more efficient. But if Salesforce's higher-value customers justify the paid spend, Salesforce might actually have superior unit economics. This challenges the initial analysis's implicit bias toward organic.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Unit economics comparison that reframes the entire budget allocation question
- **Target Agent**: Claude (requires reasoning from public financial data + industry benchmarks)
- **Execution Order**: Run late—requires earlier data for context
- **Strategic Value**: Might flip the $2M budget recommendation from organic-heavy to paid-heavy with a completely different strategic rationale

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT 2: DTC Brand Growth Analysis Follow-Up

**Context**: Initial research output shows a DTC supplement brand growing 340% year-over-year, primarily through podcast advertising and influencer partnerships. Traffic is 70% direct, 20% referral, 10% organic. Industry: Health/wellness supplements. Decision: Should a new DTC supplement brand replicate this playbook or find an alternative growth model?

**THE ACTUAL DELIVERABLE:**

---

# EXPERT QUERY PLAYBOOK
## DTC Supplement Brand Growth Model Analysis
### Decision: Growth Model Selection for New DTC Supplement Brand

---

## TIER 1: LEVERAGE QUERIES

**Query 1: The Direct Traffic Decomposition**
> "70% direct traffic for a DTC brand almost certainly isn't 'direct'—it's unattributed. Break down the likely sources: What percentage is podcast listeners typing the URL? What percentage is returning customers? What percentage is branded search miscategorized as direct? Cross-reference with branded search volume trends over the same growth period."

- **Why This Matters More Than AI's Suggestion**: "70% direct traffic" is the most commonly misunderstood metric in digital marketing. For a DTC supplement brand, this almost certainly represents podcast attribution failure—listeners hear an ad, Google the brand name, and get categorized as "direct." The REAL channel mix is probably 50-60% podcast-driven, which fundamentally changes the unit economics.
- **Deliverable Produced**: True channel attribution model for the competitor's growth
- **Target Agent**: Manis with Similar Web + Google Trends data
- **Execution Order**: Run FIRST—everything else depends on accurate attribution
- **Strategic Value**: Reveals the actual cost of customer acquisition through the channels that are ACTUALLY driving growth

**Query 2: The Podcast Economics Reconstruction**
> "Identify the top 10 podcasts this brand advertises on (using referral data, promo code mentions in podcast databases, and ad intelligence). Estimate the cost per episode for each podcast tier. Cross-reference with traffic spikes to estimate listeners-to-visitors conversion rate and cost-per-acquired-visitor from podcast advertising."

- **Why This Matters**: If podcast advertising is the real growth engine (hidden in "direct" traffic), understanding the economics per podcast tier determines whether a new brand can replicate this affordably or whether the competitor has already locked up the highest-performing inventory.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Podcast advertising ROI model with per-show economics
- **Target Agent**: Manis with podcast ad intelligence data + Similar Web traffic patterns
- **Execution Order**: Run second—requires Query 1's reattribution
- **Strategic Value**: Determines if the podcast playbook is replicable at the new brand's budget level or if the competitor has a first-mover cost advantage

**Query 3: The Retention Dependency Question**
> "For DTC supplement brands with 70%+ direct traffic, what's the estimated repeat purchase rate and customer lifetime value? Is the 340% growth driven by NEW customer acquisition or by a compounding base of repeat purchasers? Model both scenarios and their different budget implications."

- **Why This Matters**: 340% growth from new customers requires massive ongoing ad spend. 340% growth from a compounding subscriber base requires less ongoing acquisition spend and has higher margins. The growth model looks identical from the outside but demands completely different strategies to replicate.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Growth composition analysis (new vs. returning) with LTV modeling
- **Target Agent**: Claude with industry benchmark data
- **Execution Order**: Third—standalone but informs all strategy
- **Strategic Value**: Determines whether the new brand needs a massive acquisition budget or a superior retention system

**Query 4: The Influencer Concentration Risk Query**
> "The 20% referral traffic—how concentrated is it? Are there 3 influencers driving 80% of that referral traffic, or is it distributed across 50+? What's the risk profile if a top influencer switches to a competitor or gets cancelled?"

- **Why This Matters**: Concentrated referral sources create a fragile growth model. If 3 influencers drive most of the growth, the brand's trajectory is vulnerable—and those same influencers are targets for competitive poaching.
- **Deliverable Produced**: Influencer concentration risk map with vulnerability assessment
- **Target Agent**: Manis with referral data + social intelligence
- **Execution Order**: Fourth
- **Strategic Value**: Reveals attack vectors (poach their top influencers) and defense requirements (diversify referral sources from Day 1)

---

## TIER 2: DEPTH QUERIES

**Query 5: The "What Podcast Genres Convert Best" Query**
> "Across DTC supplement brands in Similar Web's dataset, which podcast categories (health/fitness, business, comedy, true crime, etc.) drive the highest traffic per advertising dollar? Is health/fitness actually the best category, or do tangential audiences convert better?"

- **Deliverable Produced**: Podcast genre efficiency ranking for supplement brands
- **Target Agent**: Manis with cross-brand referral analysis
- **Strategic Value**: Prevents the obvious mistake of only advertising on health podcasts when business or lifestyle shows might deliver cheaper, higher-intent traffic

**Query 6: The Organic Gap Assessment**
> "With only 10% organic traffic, what search terms SHOULD this brand rank for but doesn't? Estimate the monthly search volume of their addressable keyword universe and the organic traffic opportunity if they invested in SEO."

- **Deliverable Produced**: Organic opportunity map showing uncontested search territory
- **Target Agent**: SEMrush or Manis with search data
- **Strategic Value**: Identifies whether organic search is a viable secondary growth channel or if the market is too competitive

**Query 7: The Geographic Expansion Signal**
> "Is this brand's 340% growth happening uniformly across the US, or are there geographic concentrations? Are there metro areas with disproportionate growth that indicate product-market fit indicators?"

- **Deliverable Produced**: Geographic heat map of growth concentration
- **Target Agent**: Manis with Similar Web geo data
- **Strategic Value**: Reveals whether to launch nationally or focus on proven-fit metros first

---

## TIER 3: CONTRARIAN QUERIES

**Query 8: The "What If This Growth Is Unsustainable" Query**
> "Chart this brand's month-over-month growth rate for the past 12 months. Is the 340% YoY figure driven by consistent monthly growth or by a few spike months? If spikes correlate with viral moments or major podcast campaigns, the growth might be episodic rather than structural."

- **Deliverable Produced**: Growth sustainability assessment with month-level granularity
- **Strategic Value**: Prevents copying a growth model that may already be decelerating

**Query 9: The "What If Podcast Advertising Is Already Saturated" Query**
> "How many DTC brands are currently advertising on the top 50 health/wellness podcasts? Has the number of advertisers increased in the past 12 months? If podcast ad inventory is getting crowded, costs are rising—and the playbook that worked at $50 CPM might not work at $80 CPM."

- **Deliverable Produced**: Podcast advertising competitive density analysis
- **Strategic Value**: Determines if the window for affordable podcast growth is closing

**Query 10: The Alternative Model Query**
> "Identify 3 DTC supplement brands that grew 200%+ WITHOUT relying on podcast advertising. What channels drove their growth? What was their estimated customer acquisition cost compared to podcast-driven brands?"

- **Deliverable Produced**: Alternative growth model benchmarks from brands who found a different path
- **Strategic Value**: The most valuable intelligence might be discovering that a completely different playbook outperforms the obvious one—especially if podcast costs are rising
