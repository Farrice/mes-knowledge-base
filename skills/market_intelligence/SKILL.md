# 📉 Market Intelligence (The "Unfair Advantage")

> **"Data is plentiful. Insight is scarce."**
> **v2.0 (2026-02-05)**: Architecture refactored from Python scripts to Agentic Workflows after critical QA failure.

This skill transforms your agent into a **Strategic Data Broker**. Instead of just "searching" for a topic, it analyzes the *market dynamics* behind it. It tells you not just *what* people are searching for, but *why*—and whether they have their wallets out.

## ⚠️ Architecture Note
**This skill does NOT use Python scripts to generate intelligence.** All intelligence is generated by the Agent (you) following the workflow instructions. Python files in this directory are for reference or utility purposes only.

## 🧠 The Capabilities

### 1. 🔥 Trend Hunting (The "Google Trends" Layer)
*Replicates: Google Trends + Exploding Topics*
- **Capability**: Identifies rising topics *before* they saturate.
- **Method**: Agent uses `search_web` to query Reddit, Twitter, and news sources.
- **Command**: `Run /hunt-trends`

### 2. 🎯 Intent Analysis (The "Ahrefs" Layer)
*Replicates: Ahrefs Keyword Explorer*
- **Capability**: Distinguishes between "Browsers" and "Buyers".
- **Method**: Agent uses linguistic analysis AND live SERP validation.
- **Command**: `Run /analyze-intent`

### 3. 📊 Strategic Briefing (The "Agency Dossier" Layer)
*Replicates: A $5,000 SEO agency report*
- **Capability**: Generates a comprehensive keyword strategy brief with real data.
- **Method**: Agent performs Entity Understanding, Agentic Keyword Research, and sources all claims.
- **Command**: `Run /generate-brief`
