# 🧠 Genius Patterns: Market Intelligence Logic (v2 - Agentic Research)

> **⚠️ LESSON LEARNED (Feb 2026)**: Template-based keyword generation is "SLOP". All intelligence MUST be grounded in live research.

## 1. The "Wallet-Out" Protocol (Buyer Intent)
**Origin**: Ahrefs / SEMRush Logic
**Concept**: Search queries reveal the psychology of the user. We categorize them into 4 tiers of value.

### The Intent Hierarchy
1.  **Transactional (💰💰💰)**: User is ready to buy *now*.
    - *Signals*: "Buy", "Price", "Coupon", "Cheap", "Deal".
    - *SERP Signs*: 4+ Ads at the top. Google Shopping Carousel.
2.  **Commercial Investigation (💰💰)**: User is comparing options to buy *soon*.
    - *Signals*: "Best", "Top 10", "Review", "Vs", "Alternative".
    - *SERP Signs*: Affiliate sites ("Best of" lists), Comparison tables.
3.  **Informational (🧠)**: User is learning. Unlikely to buy.
    - *Signals*: "How to", "What is", "History of", "Guide".
    - *SERP Signs*: Wikipedia, Featured Snippets (Definitions).
4.  **Navigational (📍)**: User wants a specific site. Zero value for you.
    - *Signals*: "Facebook login", "Amazon", "YouTube".

## 2. The "Entity Understanding" Protocol (NEW - Critical Fix)
**Origin**: Perplexity Verification Failure (Feb 2026)
**Concept**: Before generating ANY keyword, the system MUST understand what the Niche IS.

### Entity Types
| Entity Type | Example | Correct Keyword Strategy |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Product** | "Running Shoes" | "best running shoes", "buy running shoes online" |
| **Service** | "Plumbing" | "plumber near me", "emergency plumber cost" |
| **Demographic** | "First Time Home Buyers" | Keywords for PROGRAMS that SERVE them: "first time home buyer grants", "down payment assistance" |
| **Program** | "CalHFA Loan" | "CalHFA eligibility", "CalHFA vs FHA" |

> **THE FATAL MISTAKE**: Treating a *Demographic* like a *Product*. "Buy First Time Home Buyers" is nonsense.

## 3. The "Shadow Market" Protocol
**Origin**: Samuel Thompson (Product Launch Expert)
**Concept**: Don't just look for "Trends". Look for **"Rigged Slot Machines"**.
- **The Heuristic**: A "Shadow Market" is a niche where customers are *desperate* but serviced by *amateurs*.
- **The Equation**: `Desperation` (Pain) x `Money` (Purchasing Power) / `Competition Quality` (Competency).
- **Signal**: High Search Volume for "Solution" keywords, but top results are ugly, broken, or outdated.
- **⚠️ REQUIREMENT**: This assessment MUST be based on ACTUAL SERP analysis, not guessing.

## 4. The "Retrieval Layer" Audit
**Origin**: Nathan Gotch (AI SEO)
**Concept**: In 2026, you don't just rank on Google. You must be "cited" by LLMs (Gemini, ChatGPT).
- **The Metric**: **Citational Authority**.
- **The Check**: Does the keyword trigger an "AI Overview"? If yes, your content needs to be structured as *Training Data* (Tables, Lists, Clear Definitions) to be picked up.

## 5. The "Data Grounding" Mandate (NEW - Critical Fix)
**Origin**: Perplexity Verification Failure (Feb 2026)
**Concept**: Every claim in a Strategy Brief MUST be traceable to a source.

### Required Data Points & Sources
| Data Point | Acceptable Sources |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Search Volume** | Ahrefs, SEMrush, Google Keyword Planner, Moz |
| **CPC Estimates** | Google Ads Keyword Planner, WordStream benchmarks |
| **Market Size/Stats** | Industry reports (CAR, NAR, Statista, IBISWorld) |
| **Competition** | Live SERP analysis (Who are the top 3 results?) |

> **THE RULE**: If you can't cite it, don't claim it.
