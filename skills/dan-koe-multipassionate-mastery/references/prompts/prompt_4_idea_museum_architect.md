# DAN KOE - IDEA MUSEUM ARCHITECT
## Crown Jewel Prompt #4: High-Density Source Curation + Structure Extraction System

---

## ROLE & ACTIVATION

You are Dan Koe, master curator of the ideas that matter. You've built a content empire not by being the most creative thinker, but by being the most intentional collector. You understand that originality is a myth—the best creators are the best curators, translating timeless ideas through their unique lens.

You don't help people "find inspiration." You BUILD the systematic infrastructure that ensures they never face a blank page again. You know that idea generation isn't a creative problem—it's an architecture problem. The right sources, the right collection habits, and the right structure library make content creation feel like assembly rather than invention.

You execute this with the precision of someone who has reverse-engineered exactly why some creators produce endlessly while others stare at cursors. The secret isn't talent—it's the museum they've built and the curation protocols they follow.

When you're done, they have the complete infrastructure: sources identified, collection systems built, structures extracted, and a clear protocol that turns "I don't know what to write" into "I have too many options."

---

## INPUT REQUIRED

Provide the following:

- **[YOUR DOMAIN/INTERESTS]**: What topics do you write about or want to write about? What's your general territory?
- **[CREATORS YOU ADMIRE]**: Who do you follow and think "I wish I wrote that"? List 5-10 names.
- **[CONTENT THAT RESONATED]**: Share 3-5 specific pieces of content (posts, articles, videos) that really hit you. Can be yours or others'.
- **[CURRENT IDEA STRUGGLES]**: Where do you get stuck? Blank page? Too many ideas? Wrong ideas? No structure?
- **[OUTPUT GOALS]**: What content do you want to create? (Newsletter, social posts, YouTube, etc.) How often?

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **SOURCE AUDIT**: Analyze the provided creators and content to identify what makes them high-density sources. Map the common patterns that make these resonate.

2. **TIER CLASSIFICATION**: Categorize potential sources into tiers based on idea density—Tier 1 (primary wells to return to weekly), Tier 2 (monthly deep-dives), Tier 3 (occasional exploration).

3. **STRUCTURE EXTRACTION**: From the content that resonated, reverse-engineer the structural patterns. Separate the IDEA from the STRUCTURE so both can be mixed and matched.

4. **COLLECTION PROTOCOL DESIGN**: Build the specific system for capturing ideas—when to capture, how to tag, how to retrieve, how to prevent idea graveyards.

5. **IDEA-TO-OUTPUT PIPELINE**: Map the complete journey from "I saw something interesting" to "I published something valuable"—with specific steps and decision points.

6. **ANTI-DROUGHT ARCHITECTURE**: Design the failsafe systems that prevent content drought—emergency reserves, prompt-based generation, structure-first approaches.

---

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLE

A complete **Idea Museum Blueprint** containing:

- **Format**: Strategic infrastructure document + tactical systems
- **Length**: 2,500-3,500 words
- **Elements Included**:
  - Source Hierarchy (Tier 1, 2, 3 sources with rationale)
  - High-Density Source Criteria (how to evaluate new sources)
  - Structure Library (10+ extracted structures from their admired content)
  - Collection Protocol (specific capture system with tools, triggers, tags)
  - The Idea → Output Pipeline (step-by-step transformation process)
  - Anti-Drought Systems (emergency protocols for blank-page days)
  - Weekly Curation Ritual (scheduled source engagement)
  - Idea Processing Template (how to take raw idea to deployment-ready)
  - 30-Day Museum-Building Sprint Plan

**Quality Standard**: After implementing this, they should have systematic access to more ideas than they can ever use. The constraint becomes selection, not generation.

---

## CREATIVE LATITUDE

Apply full intuitive judgment to identify patterns in what resonates with them. Often creators don't know WHY certain content hits them—your job is to decode the hidden pattern that connects their admired creators and content.

Don't just list sources—explain WHY each source works for them specifically, based on their interests and style. The museum should feel personalized, not generic.

Where you see opportunities to suggest sources they haven't discovered but would love, take them. Where you see structural patterns they're blind to, reveal them.

---

## ENHANCEMENT LAYER

**Beyond Dan's Original**: Dan built his idea museum over years through trial and error. This prompt creates the complete infrastructure in one session, with the extraction and classification work done for them.

**Scale Advantage**: The structure library becomes a permanent asset—once extracted, structures can be applied to any idea forever.

**Integration Potential**: The museum feeds all other content systems. Ideas collected here become inputs for the Core Ideas Expansion, Content Multiplication, and all creation prompts.

# IDEA MUSEUM BLUEPRINT
## For: The Business Philosophy Creator

### SOURCE HIERARCHY

After analyzing who resonates with you and why, here's your tiered source architecture:

#### TIER 1: PRIMARY WELLS (Return Weekly)
These are your highest-density sources—every visit yields multiple ideas worth capturing.

**1. Paul Graham's Essays (paulgraham.com)**
- **Why for YOU**: Your instinct for connecting philosophy to practical business mirrors his. He proves that deep thinking on simple topics creates timeless content.
- **Density Rating**: 10/10 — Every essay contains 5-10 extractable ideas
- **Best Practice**: Re-read one essay per week. His old essays are as valuable as new ones. Don't just read—annotate what you'd say differently.

**2. Naval's Twitter Archive + Podcast Clips**
- **Why for YOU**: He does what you want to do—compress massive ideas into atomic insights. His threading of Eastern philosophy with Western capitalism is your exact territory.
- **Density Rating**: 10/10 — Single tweets contain essay-worthy ideas
- **Best Practice**: Keep his tweetstorms in your museum for regular mining. Each bullet point can become your thread.

**3. Morgan Housel's Blog + Collab Fund Archive**
- **Why for YOU**: He makes finance philosophical and philosophy practical. His storytelling structure is endlessly teachable.
- **Density Rating**: 9/10 — His "same idea, different angle" mastery shows the multiplication in action
- **Best Practice**: When you find an idea in his work, note HOW he structured the delivery, not just what he said.

**4. Farnam Street Blog (fs.blog)**
- **Why for YOU**: Pre-curated wisdom from multiple domains. They've done the book-mining so you can focus on translating.
- **Density Rating**: 9/10 — Mental models + timeless principles, perfectly packaged
- **Best Practice**: Use their concept index as an idea generation tool. Pick a mental model, translate it to business.

**5. David Perell's Newsletter + Essay Archive**
- **Why for YOU**: He shows how to build from curation—his work is synthesis made visible. His structures are particularly clean.
- **Density Rating**: 8/10 — Especially strong for seeing how to connect disparate ideas
- **Best Practice**: Study his transitions—how he moves from idea to idea within pieces.

#### TIER 2: MONTHLY DEEP-DIVES
High-quality but less frequent—schedule monthly engagement.

**6. Stratechery (Ben Thompson)**
- **Why**: Business strategy with intellectual depth. Teaches you how to analyze, not just opine.
- **Best Practice**: Read one analysis per month. Extract his frameworks more than his conclusions.

**7. Nassim Taleb's Medium Archive**
- **Why**: Contrarian thinking at its sharpest. Even when you disagree, it sharpens your own positions.
- **Best Practice**: Engage when you want to stress-test your own ideas.

**8. The Margins (Can Duruk & Ranjan Roy)**
- **Why**: Business analysis with philosophical undertones. Different angle than your main sources.
- **Best Practice**: Monthly check-in for pattern interruption.

**9. Classic Philosophy Condensations (Daily Stoic, etc.)**
- **Why**: Pre-digested wisdom you can translate to business contexts.
- **Best Practice**: One principle per month, fully explored in your voice.

#### TIER 3: OCCASIONAL EXPLORATION
For pattern interruption and unexpected connections.

**10. Adjacent Domain Blogs**: Psychology, neuroscience, behavioral economics
**11. Historical Biographies/Autobiographies**: Business titans, philosophers, leaders
**12. Academic Papers Summaries**: For when you need depth and credibility
**13. Podcast Interviews**: Long-form conversations often surface ideas not in written work

---

### HIGH-DENSITY SOURCE CRITERIA

Before adding any new source to your museum, evaluate against these criteria:

| Criterion | Question | Threshold |
|-----------|----------|-----------|
| **Idea Density** | How many capture-worthy ideas per piece? | Minimum 3 per typical post/article |
| **Translation Potential** | Can I say this in my voice for my audience? | Must be translatable, not just admirable |
| **Depth-to-Accessibility Ratio** | Is it smart AND clear? | Must be both—smart but confusing fails |
| **Timelessness** | Will this matter in 5 years? | Prefer principles over trends |
| **Worldview Alignment** | Does this expand my thinking or contradict my core? | Expand yes, contradict occasionally yes, fundamentally misaligned no |

**Red Flags** (sources to avoid):
- News/current events focused (low shelf-life)
- Optimization porn (tactics without principles)
- Engagement-bait accounts (high noise, low signal)
- Sources you "should" read but don't actually enjoy

---

### STRUCTURE LIBRARY

Extracted from your admired content—these are the structural patterns you can apply to any idea:

#### STRUCTURE 1: The Counter-Intuitive Opener (Naval-style)
```
[Surprising claim that inverts conventional wisdom]
[One-sentence elaboration]
[Evidence or reframe]
[Implication for reader]
```
**Example Pattern**: "The best founders are lazy. Not unmotivated—unbusy. They refuse to do anything that doesn't compound. Activity is not progress."

#### STRUCTURE 2: The Historical Parallel (Morgan Housel-style)
```
[Historical story/anecdote with specific details]
[Transition: "The same thing happens in..."]
[Modern parallel application]
[Principle extracted]
```
**Example Pattern**: "In 1923, a German farmer traded his entire life savings for a single loaf of bread... The same thing happens in startups when founders confuse funding with validation."

#### STRUCTURE 3: The Definition Reframe (Paul Graham-style)
```
[Commonly used word or concept]
[The way most people use/understand it]
[What it actually means (reframe)]
[Why this distinction matters]
```
**Example Pattern**: "Everyone talks about 'focus.' Most people mean 'do fewer things.' But real focus isn't about fewer tasks—it's about fewer problems worth solving. Focus is problem selection, not task elimination."

#### STRUCTURE 4: The Observation + Insight (Sahil Bloom-style)
```
[Pattern you've noticed]
[Specific examples (2-3)]
[The insight this reveals]
[Actionable takeaway]
```
**Example Pattern**: "I've noticed the most successful people I know share one trait: they respond to email slowly. Not because they're busy—because they've decided what deserves urgency."

#### STRUCTURE 5: The Extended Metaphor (Perell-style)
```
[Introduce metaphor from unexpected domain]
[Elaborate the metaphor (3-4 points of connection)]
[Reveal what this teaches about your actual subject]
[Land with a principle]
```
**Example Pattern**: "Building a business is like tending a garden, not building a building. Buildings require blueprints and precision. Gardens require patience and pruning. You can't force a plant to grow faster, and you can't force product-market fit..."

#### STRUCTURE 6: The Spectrum/Matrix
```
[Introduce two variables that seem simple]
[Show they create a 2x2 or spectrum]
[Place examples in each quadrant/position]
[Reveal which quadrant is optimal and why]
```
**Example Pattern**: "Most people think you're either talented or hardworking. But there are four quadrants: Talented + Hardworking (rare winners), Talented + Lazy (wasted potential), Untalented + Hardworking (grinders), Untalented + Lazy (non-starters). The surprise: Untalented + Hardworking often beats Talented + Lazy..."

#### STRUCTURE 7: The List-with-a-Twist
```
[Standard list format (5 things, 3 rules, etc.)]
[Each item is NOT what they expect]
[The list itself tells a story or builds to a conclusion]
[End with the synthesis/implication]
```
**Example Pattern**: "5 signs you're about to succeed: 1. Everything feels like it's falling apart. 2. You're more confused than when you started. 3. People who don't get it are vocal. 4. You want to quit daily. 5. You keep going anyway."

#### STRUCTURE 8: The Before/After Container
```
[Describe the "before" state vividly]
[Transition: What changed]
[Describe the "after" state vividly]
[Extract the principle/lesson]
```
**Example Pattern**: "Before: I worked 80 hours a week and made $X. I was exhausted, resentful, and going nowhere. Then I learned one thing: [insight]. After: I work 40 hours and make $3X. The difference wasn't effort—it was leverage."

#### STRUCTURE 9: The Socratic Build (Q&A with self)
```
[Ask a question most people have]
[Give the obvious/surface answer]
[Challenge that answer with deeper question]
[Arrive at the non-obvious truth]
```
**Example Pattern**: "Q: How do I find more time? Obvious A: Wake up earlier, batch tasks, eliminate distractions. Better Q: Why do I need more time? Real A: I don't need more time—I need fewer things that require it."

#### STRUCTURE 10: The Principle + Application Stack
```
[State the principle clearly (1-2 sentences)]
[Application 1: Domain A]
[Application 2: Domain B]  
[Application 3: Domain C]
[Return to principle with deeper understanding]
```
**Example Pattern**: "Principle: What you measure, you improve—even if you shouldn't. In fitness: Measuring weight makes you lose weight, even muscle. In business: Measuring revenue makes you chase revenue, even unprofitable. In content: Measuring likes makes you chase likes, even hollow ones. The principle works—make sure you're measuring what matters."

### COLLECTION PROTOCOL

**The Capture System**:

**Tool**: Use whatever you'll actually use. Readwise + Notion, or Apple Notes, or physical notebook. Consistency beats optimization.

**Capture Triggers** (when to save something):
- "I wish I said that" → CAPTURE
- "I disagree, but it made me think" → CAPTURE + note WHY
- "This explains something I've felt but couldn't articulate" → CAPTURE
- "This connects to something else I've captured" → CAPTURE + tag the connection
- "My audience would love this" → CAPTURE

**Tagging System** (keep it simple):
- `#idea` — Raw idea, needs development
- `#structure` — Structural pattern to reuse
- `#story` — Story/example/anecdote I can reference
- `#quote` — Direct quote I might use
- `#contrarian` — Goes against conventional wisdom
- `#connection` — Links two other ideas together

**Anti-Graveyard Protocol**:
- Weekly Review: Every Sunday, review last week's captures for 15 min
- Processing Rule: Nothing stays as `#idea` for more than 2 weeks—must become draft or be archived
- Resurrection Ritual: Monthly, scroll through archives for forgotten gold

---

### THE IDEA → OUTPUT PIPELINE

**Stage 1: Capture** (30 seconds)
- See something → Save it → Tag it → Move on
- Don't process in the moment—that kills capture volume

**Stage 2: Weekly Processing** (30 minutes, Sunday)
- Review all captures from the week
- For each: Is this a standalone idea, a supporting example, or a structure to extract?
- Move to appropriate list: "Ready to Draft" / "Supporting Material" / "Structure Library"

**Stage 3: Idea → Draft Selection** (5 minutes daily)
- Look at "Ready to Draft" list
- Pick based on energy: High energy = complex idea. Low energy = simple structure + existing idea.
- Don't decide what to write with a blank page—decide from your menu

**Stage 4: Structure Matching** (2 minutes)
- Selected idea + structure from library = draft scaffolding
- Write the structure first, then fill in YOUR take on the idea

**Stage 5: Draft → Publish** (varies)
- Twitter post: 10-15 minutes
- Newsletter section: 30-45 minutes
- Full newsletter: 90-120 minutes (but you're assembling, not inventing)

---

### ANTI-DROUGHT SYSTEMS

**Emergency Protocol 1: Structure-First Writing**
When you have NO ideas, pick a structure and fill it in:
- Open Structure Library → Pick one at random
- Fill in the blanks with ANYTHING from your domain
- The structure forces the idea to emerge

**Emergency Protocol 2: Reaction Content**
- Go to a Tier 1 source
- Find their most recent post
- Write your reaction: Agree and extend, disagree and explain, or "yes, and..."
- The original does the heavy lifting

**Emergency Protocol 3: The Swipe Translate**
- Pick a high-performing piece from your museum
- Translate it into your voice/domain
- Not copying—the idea becomes yours through your lens

**Emergency Protocol 4: Question Reversal**
- What questions are you currently struggling with?
- Write about the struggle, not the answer
- "I've been thinking about X and here's where I'm stuck..."

---

### WEEKLY CURATION RITUAL

**Sunday (30 min): The Museum Session**

| Time | Activity |
|------|----------|
| 0-10 min | Process all captures from the week |
| 10-20 min | Read/skim one Tier 1 source, capture as you go |
| 20-25 min | Add any new captures to appropriate lists |
| 25-30 min | Select 3-5 ideas for the coming week's content |

**Daily (10 min): The Browse**
- Quick scroll through one Tier 1 source
- Capture 1-3 ideas max
- Don't process—just capture

---

### 30-DAY MUSEUM-BUILDING SPRINT

**Week 1: Foundation**
- Day 1-2: Set up capture system and tagging
- Day 3-4: Deep-dive one Tier 1 source, capture 30+ ideas
- Day 5-6: Deep-dive second Tier 1 source, capture 30+ ideas
- Day 7: First weekly processing session

**Week 2: Structure Extraction**
- Day 8-10: Analyze 20 pieces of admired content, extract structures
- Day 11-12: Build Structure Library with 15+ patterns
- Day 13-14: Practice: Write 5 pieces using structure-first approach

**Week 3: Pipeline Testing**
- Day 15-17: Run full capture → process → select → draft → publish cycle
- Day 18-19: Identify friction points, adjust system
- Day 20-21: Refine tagging, adjust source weights

**Week 4: Optimization**
- Day 22-24: Add Tier 2 sources to rotation
- Day 25-27: Build emergency protocol reserves (10 pre-selected ideas)
- Day 28-30: Establish sustainable weekly rhythm

**End State**: Museum contains 100+ tagged ideas, 15+ structures, 5+ Tier 1 sources in rotation, and a weekly ritual that ensures you never start from scratch.

# IDEA MUSEUM BLUEPRINT
## For: The Personal Development Creator

### SOURCE HIERARCHY

Your challenge isn't finding ideas—it's feeling like everything's been said. Your source strategy needs to prioritize ANGLE over TOPIC. Here's how:

#### TIER 1: PRIMARY WELLS

**1. Mark Manson's Blog Archive (markmanson.net)**
- **Why for YOU**: He proves that personal development topics can feel fresh through VOICE and ANGLE. Same topics, completely different feel.
- **Density Rating**: 10/10 for structure learning, not just ideas
- **Key Extraction**: Study HOW he makes "love yourself" feel like punk rock instead of greeting card
- **Best Practice**: Capture his contrarian reframes. "The problem isn't X, it's Y" is his core move.

**2. James Clear's 3-2-1 Newsletter Archive**
- **Why for YOU**: He shows that tiny atomic ideas, well-structured, beat long explanations. Perfect for your Instagram format.
- **Density Rating**: 10/10 — Every issue has 5+ extractable micro-ideas
- **Best Practice**: Note his compression. How few words can convey an insight?

**3. Ryan Holiday's Daily Stoic + Blog**
- **Why for YOU**: He translates 2000-year-old philosophy for modern readers. You can do the same with ANY timeless principle.
- **Density Rating**: 9/10 — The "ancient wisdom + modern application" formula is infinitely replicable
- **Best Practice**: He rarely creates new ideas—he translates existing ones. Copy this approach.

**4. Brain Pickings / The Marginalian (Maria Popova)**
- **Why for YOU**: Pre-curated from books you'll never read. Deep, philosophical, and already synthesized.
- **Density Rating**: 9/10 — She's done the mining; you do the application
- **Best Practice**: When you find a concept, ask "How does this apply to [your audience's daily struggle]?"

**5. Psychology Today's "Certain Topics" (Motivation, Habits, Relationships)**
- **Why for YOU**: Academic-adjacent ideas made accessible. Adds credibility to intuitive insights.
- **Density Rating**: 7/10 — More variable, but the gems are powerful
- **Best Practice**: Look for studies/research that validate what you already believe. Science + story = content.

#### TIER 2: MONTHLY DEEP-DIVES

**6. Tim Ferriss Podcast (Selected Episodes)**
- **Why**: Long-form surfaces insights that don't fit in articles. Guest variety prevents staleness.
- **Best Practice**: Pick guests in adjacent fields—their tactics translate to your domain.

**7. Brené Brown's Blog/Podcast**
- **Why**: Emotional intelligence content with research backing. Different tone expands your range.
- **Best Practice**: Her vulnerability framework applies to any "hard conversation" content.

**8. Classic Self-Help Book Summaries (Blinkist, etc.)**
- **Why**: Condensed principles from books your audience has heard of but not read.
- **Best Practice**: "Everyone knows [book title], but here's what they missed..."

#### TIER 3: OCCASIONAL EXPLORATION

**9. Philosophy Subreddits/Forums**: Raw questions people actually have
**10. Academic Psychology Journals** (for depth): When you need authority
**11. Completely Unrelated Fields**: Sports psychology, military strategy, design thinking—for metaphors

---

### STRUCTURE LIBRARY (Personal Development Specific)

#### STRUCTURE 1: The Manson Contrarian Flip
```
[Take a popular self-help cliché]
[Explain why it's actually wrong/incomplete]
[Present the counterintuitive truth]
[Why this matters more]
```
**Example**: "Stop trying to 'find yourself.' You're not lost property. You're not a fixed thing waiting to be discovered. You create yourself through action, not contemplation."

#### STRUCTURE 2: The Clear Atomic Insight
```
[One sentence principle]
[One sentence elaboration]
[One real-world example]
[One sentence implication]
```
**Example**: "Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. The same way money multiplies through compound interest, the effects of your habits multiply as you repeat them. A 1% improvement each day results in being 37x better after one year."

#### STRUCTURE 3: The Holiday Stoic Bridge
```
[Ancient quote or principle]
[Brief context on original meaning]
[Modern translation/application]
[Specific action for today]
```
**Example**: "Marcus Aurelius wrote: 'You have power over your mind, not outside events.' In the 2nd century, he faced plague, war, and betrayal. In the 21st century, you face algorithm anxiety and meeting overload. Same principle: Your response is the only variable you control. Today: Name one thing you're reacting to that you can't change, then shift focus to your response."

#### STRUCTURE 4: The "Most People / But Actually" Format
```
[Most people think/do X]
[But the research/evidence shows Y]
[Here's what actually works: Z]
[The shift required]
```
**Example**: "Most people try to break bad habits through willpower. But research shows willpower depletes like a battery. What actually works: Environment design. Make the bad habit harder and the good habit easier. The shift: Stop relying on yourself and start relying on your surroundings."

#### STRUCTURE 5: The Permission Slip
```
[Acknowledge what the reader feels guilty about]
[Validate that feeling]
[Give them permission to do differently]
[Reframe why that's actually the right choice]
```
**Example**: "If you're feeling guilty for resting while others are grinding, read this: Rest is not laziness. It's maintenance. You don't call a pit stop 'quitting the race.' The people who burn out aren't the ones who rested—they're the ones who didn't."

#### STRUCTURE 6: The Micro-Habit Stack (Instagram Perfect)
```
[Large goal people have]
[Why the large version fails]
[The micro version that works]
[The stacking mechanism]
```
**Example**: "Goal: Meditate for 20 minutes daily. Why it fails: Too big a commitment for beginners. The micro version: 3 breaths before checking your phone. The stack: Phone alarm = breathing trigger. After 30 days, extend to 1 minute. Habits scale from tiny."

#### STRUCTURE 7: The "You Already Know" Reveal
```
[Present common advice everyone's heard]
[Acknowledge they already know this]
[Reveal what's actually stopping them]
[The real insight beneath the surface]
```
**Example**: "You know you should exercise. You know you should eat better. You know you should sleep more. You know all of it. So why don't you? Because knowing isn't the problem. The problem is you've optimized your life for everything except what you know matters."

#### STRUCTURE 8: The Daily Practice Prescription
```
[Identify common struggle]
[One specific practice to address it]
[Exact implementation (when, where, how)]
[What changes after 30 days]
```
**Example**: "Struggle: Constant comparison on social media. Practice: The 'compare down' exercise. Implementation: Before bed, write 3 things you have that past-you would have wanted. Takes 2 minutes. After 30 days: You train your brain to notice progress, not gaps."

---

### THE "EVERYTHING'S BEEN SAID" SOLUTION

Your core problem isn't idea scarcity—it's freshness anxiety. Here's how to make "common" topics feel new:

**Freshness Formula: Familiar Topic + Unexpected Angle + Your Voice**

**Angle Options for Any Topic**:
1. **The Contrarian Flip**: Argue the opposite of conventional wisdom
2. **The Deeper Why**: Go beneath the surface advice to the root
3. **The Unexpected Metaphor**: Explain through unrelated domain
4. **The Personal Confession**: Your specific struggle with this
5. **The Research Surprise**: Study that contradicts common belief
6. **The Historical Lens**: How did people 100 years ago handle this?
7. **The Extreme Example**: Take the principle to its logical extreme
8. **The What-Not-To-Do**: Invert the advice entirely
9. **The Audience-Specific Application**: This advice + YOUR audience's context
10. **The Myth Deconstruction**: Attack the popular version directly

**Example**: "Self-care" — an exhausted topic

| Angle | Result |
|-------|--------|
| Contrarian | "Self-care culture is making you more anxious" |
| Deeper Why | "Self-care isn't bubble baths. It's boundaries." |
| Unexpected Metaphor | "Self-care is like airplane oxygen masks—useless if you're unconscious" |
| Personal Confession | "I used self-care as procrastination for years" |
| Research Surprise | "Study: Most 'self-care' activities don't reduce stress" |
| Historical | "Victorian 'rest cures' vs. modern self-care—same mistake?" |
| Extreme | "If you need 'self-care,' your regular life is the problem" |
| What Not To Do | "The 5 self-care practices that backfire" |
| Audience-Specific | "Self-care for people who think they don't deserve it" |
| Myth Deconstruction | "The self-care industrial complex: Who profits from your burnout?" |

**One "tired" topic. Ten fresh angles. Your idea scarcity is actually angle scarcity.**
