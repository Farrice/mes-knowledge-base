# Genius Patterns

The unconscious competence patterns of Alex Copper, decoded for replication.

## 1. Research-First Creative Philosophy
**Pattern**: Never starts creative ideation without deep-dive research. Believes "creative block" is actually just "information deficit."
**Execute**: Spend 50% of total project time on research before writing a single line of copy.
**Success Metric**: Discovery of at least one "new pocket of audience" or angle per session.

## 2. Market Sophistication Calibration
**Pattern**: Instantly adjusts messaging based on how saturated the market is.
**Execute**: 
- High Sophistication (Acne): Lead with mechanism differentiation and skepticism validation.
- Low Sophistication (New Gadget): Lead with problem education and awareness.
**Success Metric**: Engagement rates on first batch match historic benchmarks immediately.

## 3. Visual Telegraphing
**Pattern**: Evaluates ads with sound OFF first. Asks "Does this look like it's for my audience?"
**Execute**: Design the first frame so the target viewer self-identifies via props, setting, or casting.
**Success Metric**: Thumb-stop rate increases; 3-second view rate increases.

## 4. The Crossbow Principle (Agitation)
**Pattern**: Delays the product reveal as long as possible to build tension ("pulling back the bow").
**Execute**: For problem-aware audiences, push product intro to 60-90 seconds. Validate the problem deeply first.
**Success Metric**: Hold rate past 60 seconds; completion rate on long-form.

## 5. Format Follows Messaging
**Pattern**: Never asks "what format?" first. Asks "what message?" then selects format.
**Execute**: Define angle -> Select Format. (Authority message -> Podcast format; Trust message -> Founder story).
**Success Metric**: Higher creative hit rate; fewer "good format, wrong message" failures.

## 6. Context Engineering Over Prompting
**Pattern**: Feeds AI massive context before asking for output. Treats AI like a new hire.
**Execute**: Create "Context Documents" for every brand/product. Load them before any request.
**Success Metric**: AI outputs require <20% editing; first-pass quality high.

## 7. Model Selection as Strategy
**Pattern**: Treats casting as a variable equal to copy.
**Execute**: Evaluate talent on "authority transfer" - do they look like they know what they're talking about?
**Success Metric**: Lower CPA on creator ads; higher trust signals in comments.

## 8. Winner Stacking Architecture
**Pattern**: Combines proven winning hooks/bodies into new "super ads" rather than starting from scratch.
**Execute**: Take Hook A (Winner) + Body B (Winner) + CTA C (Winner) = New Creative.
**Success Metric**: Extended lifespan of winning assets; consistent performance.

## 9. TikTok Shop Study
**Pattern**: Studies TikTok Shop creators (paid on commission) rather than brand creators (paid on views).
**Execute**: Watch 50 TikTok Shop videos weekly. Analyze their "close."
**Success Metric**: Higher conversion rate on video creative.

## 10. AI as Amplifier, Not Creator
**Pattern**: Uses AI to scale volume of good ideas, not to generate the ideas themselves.
**Execute**: Human defines strategy/angle -> AI generates 10 variations -> Human filters -> AI polishes.
**Success Metric**: 10x output volume without quality degradation.

## 11. The 60/40 Funnel Inversion
**Pattern**: Spends 60% of budget/effort on problem-aware/unaware top-of-funnel content.
**Execute**: Resist the urge to make only bottom-funnel product ads. Build the pipeline.
**Success Metric**: Stabilized CAC at scale; ability to spend higher budgets.

## 12. Custom GPT Ecosystem
**Pattern**: Builds a specific GPT for every recurring task.
**Execute**: Identify repeated thought process -> diverse examples -> build GPT -> refine.
**Success Metric**: Reduced cognitive load on routine strategy tasks.

## 13. Organic-to-Paid Translation
**Pattern**: Spots organic trends and immediately adapts them for paid (with a CTA).
**Execute**: "Can this meme format carry my sales message?"
**Success Metric**: Lower CPMs due to native feel; high engagement.

## 14. Authority Calibration
**Pattern**: Knowing EXACTLY what "authority" looks like to a specific demographic.
**Execute**: Match visual cues to audience trust triggers (White coat? Tattoos? suit? Gym gear?).
**Success Metric**: Comment sentiment analysis showing trust/belief.

## 15. The Anti-Formula Mindset
**Pattern**: Skepticism of all "rules" (including these) when data says otherwise.
**Execute**: Test the opposite of best practices. (Long text on bare video? Bad lighting?).
**Success Metric**: Discovery of "outlier" winners that competitors won't copy.
