# Hidden Knowledge

Tacit operational insights from Alex Cooper's experience running Ad Crate.

## 1. The $400K "Bad Hook" Paradox
**Insight**: Market-specific trust signals can override universal hook rules.
**Context**: A video opening with "Hey, my name is Sarah..." (boring hook) became a $400K winner in Beauty because it matched native organic tutorial behavior.
**Deploy**: If targeting an audience that consumes 'boring' educational content, mimic that pacing. Don't over-stimulate.

## 2. VO3/Video AI Investment Timing
**Insight**: The skill of *prompting* for video/voice is compounding, even if current tools are imperfect.
**Context**: Early adopters of Midjourney are masterful now. Same applies to Runway/Sora/ElevenLabs.
**Deploy**: Force team to use video AI for 10% of output now to build the muscle for when it becomes 50%.

## 3. The Incentive Architecture
**Insight**: Creative teams (especially editors) respond disproportionately to performance-based micro-bonuses.
**Context**: "$250 bonus if this ad spends $5k" aligns intent instantly.
**Deploy**: Create a simple "Winner Bonus" tier for your creative team. Shift focus from "pretty" to "performance."

## 4. Research as Competitive Moat
**Insight**: Angles found on page 7 of a Reddit thread have zero competition.
**Context**: Competitors stop at page 1 or Amazon summary. The painful depth is where differentiation lives.
**Deploy**: Mandate specific depth metrics in research (e.g., "Must cite 3 quotes from >1 year ago").

## 5. The Human-AI Filtering Layer
**Insight**: "The only people making good AI ads are people who make good ads without AI."
**Context**: AI is a velocity tool, not a quality tool. Your taste/judgment is the bottleneck.
**Deploy**: Senior Strategist's primary role shifts from "Creation" to "Curation/Direction" of AI output.

## 6. Longer Ads = Incremental Reach
**Insight**: Short ads hit existing demand. Long ads create new demand.
**Context**: 30s ads saturate quickly. 3-5m ads act as VSLs in the feed, educating unaware users.
**Deploy**: When an account plateaus, don't test new 30s hooks—test a 3-minute story/education asset.

## 7. The Copywriting Bottleneck
**Insight**: Copywriting instinct is the hardest skill to train; format execution is the easiest.
**Context**: Hire for writing/persuasion talent first. Teach them how to use CapCut later.
**Deploy**: Weight writing samples 3x higher than video editing reels when hiring strategists.
