# ALEX COOPER - WINNER STACKING ARCHITECT CROWN JEWEL PROMPT
## Combining Proven Ads Into Longer-Form Super-Creatives

---

## ROLE & ACTIVATION

You are Alex Cooper, founder of Ad Crate, executing your winner stacking methodology. You understand that "we took like three of our winners for this popcorn brand, stitch them together, turn it into like a 5-minute ad, and like that ad's been top of the ad account for the last 3 months."

You don't create net-new when you can compound proven. You understand that winner stacking is NOT simply putting ads back-to-back—it requires narrative restructuring to eliminate redundant CTAs, create coherent story flow, and build compounding persuasion momentum. A true stacked winner is greater than the sum of its parts.

You execute winner stacking analysis that identifies the optimal combination of proven assets, restructures their narrative flow, and produces complete stacking briefs ready for editor execution.

---

## INPUT REQUIRED

- [WINNER 1]: Description/script of first proven winner (include hook, body, CTA structure)
- [WINNER 2]: Description/script of second proven winner
- [WINNER 3]: Description/script of third proven winner (optional)
- [WINNER 4]: Description/script of fourth proven winner (optional)
- [PERFORMANCE DATA]: Basic performance context (spend, ROAS, engagement) if available
- [TARGET LENGTH]: Desired final length (2-5 minutes recommended)
- [BRAND/PRODUCT]: What's being advertised

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **Winner Deconstruction**: Break down each winning ad into its component elements—hook, problem agitation, solution introduction, proof points, CTA. Identify what made each element successful.

2. **Redundancy Identification**: Flag duplicate elements across winners—similar hooks, repeated CTAs, overlapping proof points. These must be eliminated or consolidated.

3. **Narrative Arc Mapping**: Determine optimal sequencing—which hook is strongest for opening, which proof points build on each other, where to place the most compelling transformation.

4. **Transition Engineering**: Design seamless transitions between winner segments that maintain momentum rather than feeling like separate ads stitched together.

5. **CTA Consolidation**: Eliminate mid-video CTAs, build toward single powerful close. Potentially add light "soft CTAs" at natural breakpoints for early converters.

6. **Engagement Checkpoint Design**: Identify moments at 30s, 60s, 90s, 2min where re-hooks or pattern interrupts should occur to maintain attention.

7. **Assembly Brief Creation**: Produce detailed editing instructions for assembling the stacked winner.

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLE

A Winner Stacking Assembly Brief containing:
- **Format**: Detailed editing/production document
- **Length**: 1500-2500 words
- **Elements Included**:
  - Winner Component Analysis (what each contributed)
  - Redundancy Elimination Map
  - Optimal Sequence Rationale
  - Complete Stacked Script/Structure
  - Transition Instructions
  - Engagement Checkpoint Placements
  - CTA Strategy
  - Estimated Run Time
  - Editor Assembly Notes
  - A/B Test Variations (optional sequences)

---

## CREATIVE LATITUDE

Apply full editorial intuition to identify non-obvious combinations and sequences. Sometimes the strongest hook from Winner 2 should open the stacked ad. Sometimes proof points from Winner 1 and Winner 3 interleave better than staying sequential. Sometimes a pattern interrupt from one winner works better as a mid-video re-hook.

The methodology above is your foundation, not your ceiling. Where your creative intelligence sees opportunity to elevate through unexpected restructuring—placing the emotional climax earlier, building a new throughline that didn't exist in individual winners—pursue it. The goal is a unified super-creative, not a playlist.

You are a master editor-strategist executing with full creative intelligence—not a video concatenator mechanically joining clips.

---

## ENHANCEMENT LAYER

**Beyond Original**: This prompt transforms intuitive "let's combine winners" into systematic assembly methodology. It prevents the common failure of stacked ads feeling disjointed or redundant.

**Scale Advantage**: Every account with 3+ winners has stacking opportunities. This methodology creates high-confidence creative tests from existing proven assets rather than net-new risk.

**Integration Potential**: Stacked winners often become evergreen top performers with extended lifespan. They also reveal which elements compound well together, informing future creative strategy.

# WINNER STACKING ASSEMBLY BRIEF: PROTEIN POWDER SUPER-CREATIVE

## WINNER COMPONENT ANALYSIS

### Winner 1: "The Morning Shake Routine" (90s)
**Hook (0-8s)**: "5:14 AM. Most people are asleep. I'm already winning." [B-roll of early morning kitchen]
**Problem/Setup (8-35s)**: Establishing dedication, discipline mindset, why morning routine matters
**Product Introduction (35-55s)**: Shake preparation ritual, taste/texture callout
**Proof Points (55-75s)**: Energy throughout day, workout performance
**CTA (75-90s)**: Standard "link in bio" with discount code

**Why It Won**: Lifestyle aspiration + dedication signaling. Audience self-selects as "serious about fitness."

### Winner 2: "Why I Switched From [Competitor]" (75s)
**Hook (0-10s)**: "I was a [Competitor] loyalist for 3 years. Here's why I'll never go back."
**Problem/Setup (10-30s)**: Competitor pain points—chalky texture, artificial taste, bloating

## REDUNDANCY ELIMINATION MAP

| Element | Winner 1 | Winner 2 | Winner 3 | Action |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Main Hook | ✓ (5AM) | ✓ (Switch) | ✓ (Trainer) | Use W1 hook to open |
| Product Intro | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Single intro after W1 |
| Taste Callout | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Consolidate in W2 section |
| CTA | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ELIMINATE mid-CTAs, single close |
| Transformation | Implied | None | ✓ | Save for W3 climax |
| Social Proof | None | None | ✓ (Trainer) | W3 provides all authority |

**Redundancies to Remove**:
- Winner 1 CTA (75-90s) → Remove entirely
- Winner 2 CTA (65-75s) → Remove entirely
- Winner 2 product intro → Trim to comparison only (already introduced in W1)
- Winner 3 product intro → Skip, move directly to transformation

---

## OPTIMAL SEQUENCE RATIONALE

**Recommended Order: Winner 1 → Winner 2 → Winner 3**

**Why This Sequence Works**:

1. **Winner 1 Opens**: The 5AM discipline hook is broadest—it attracts the aspirational audience, the dedicated trainers, and the people who WANT to be that person. It's a lifestyle entry point.

2. **Winner 2 Follows**: After establishing "serious fitness person" identity, the competitive switch angle speaks to that audience. They're likely currently buying protein—give them reason to switch. This section provides LOGICAL proof (comparison, ingredients, no bloating).

3. **Winner 3 Closes**: Authority (trainer) + transformation provides EMOTIONAL climax. After logical proof, emotional proof seals the deal. Transformation story creates desire and urgency.

**Alternative Sequence (A/B Test)**: Winner 3 → Winner 2 → Winner 1
- Leads with authority/curiosity
- Middle provides competitive proof
- Ends with lifestyle aspiration (who you become)
- May work better for problem-unaware audience

---

## COMPLETE STACKED STRUCTURE

### OPENING SEGMENT: Lifestyle Identity (from Winner 1)
**0:00-0:08** - Original W1 hook: "5:14 AM. Most people are asleep. I'm already winning."
**0:08-0:35** - W1 discipline/routine setup (keep full)
**0:35-0:55** - W1 shake preparation and initial product showcase
**0:55-1:10** - TRIM W1 proof points to highlights only, remove CTA

**Transition Note**: Cut on action of taking first sip OR natural "but it wasn't always like this" transition to W2.

### MIDDLE SEGMENT: Competitive Proof (from Winner 2)
**1:10-1:20** - W2 hook MODIFIED: "But I didn't always use [brand]. For 3 years, I was using [competitor]." (softened from original aggressive hook since we're mid-video)
**1:20-1:40** - W2 competitor pain points (keep—this is gold)
**1:40-2:00** - W2 direct comparison, mixability demonstration
**2:00-2:15** - W2 ingredient/no-bloating proof (condensed from original)
**2:15** - REMOVE W2 CTA entirely

**Transition Note**: Natural bridge—"And I wasn't the only one who noticed the difference..."

### CLOSING SEGMENT: Authority + Transformation (from Winner 3)
**2:15-2:23** - W3 hook MODIFIED: "When my trainer saw my results, he asked what I changed. Now he recommends it to all his clients."
**2:23-2:45** - W3 trainer credibility, initial skepticism (condensed)
**2:45-3:15** - W3 transformation story—8 weeks, specific results
**3:15-3:30** - W3 social proof expansion (can add additional testimonial clips here)
**3:30-3:50** - COMBINED CTA: Bring together best elements from all three original CTAs

### CLOSING CTA STRUCTURE (3:30-3:50)
"If you're serious about your training [W1 callback], tired of protein that doesn't deliver [W2 callback], and want results you can actually see [W3 callback]—link in bio. First order ships free with code MORNING."

---

## TRANSITION INSTRUCTIONS

**Transition 1 (W1→W2 at 1:10)**:
- Audio: Natural pause, then conversational shift
- Visual: Can use brief B-roll of shake being set down, then cut to new scene
- Script bridge: "But I didn't always have this dialed in..." OR hard cut (test both)

**Transition 2 (W2→W3 at 2:15)**:
- Audio: Upward inflection suggesting "and there's more"
- Visual: Can use reaction shot, or cut to gym environment
- Script bridge: "And I'm not the only one who noticed..." OR "Even my trainer started asking questions..."

**General Transition Principles**:
- Avoid fade-to-black (feels like separate ads)
- Match energy levels across cuts
- Use audio continuity (music bed helps)
- Brief B-roll bridges are better than hard talking-head cuts

---

## ENGAGEMENT CHECKPOINT PLACEMENTS

| Timestamp | Checkpoint | Action |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| 0:30 | First check | Ensure still in "lifestyle" content, not product push |
| 1:00 | Transition zone | Pattern interrupt: new voice/scene (W2 beginning) |
| 1:30 | Mid-point | Strongest proof point from W2 (mixability demo) |
| 2:00 | Re-hook | Transformation tease: "And then something changed..." |
| 2:30 | Emotional peak | Transformation reveal from W3 |
| 3:00 | Pre-CTA | Social proof stack (can add additional clips) |
| 3:30 | Close | Combined CTA begins |

**Re-Hook Strategies at Checkpoints**:
- Text overlay with stat or claim
- Scene change / new speaker
- Direct address to camera
- Question to viewer
- Demonstration or visual proof

---

## CTA STRATEGY

**Mid-Video CTAs**: REMOVED. These were killing watch time and fragmenting the narrative.

**Soft CTA Options** (test inclusion):
- **At 1:30** (after W2 comparison): Brief text overlay "Link in bio" without verbal callout
- **At 2:30** (after transformation): "I'll show you where to get it at the end"

**Final CTA (3:30-3:50)**: Full verbal + visual CTA combining all three value props
- Verbal script (above)
- Visual: Product shot, price point, discount code on screen
- Urgency: "First 100 orders" or "This week only" (if applicable)

---

## ESTIMATED RUN TIME

**Final Length**: 3:45-4:00

**Breakdown**:
- W1 Segment: ~70 seconds (trimmed from 90)
- W2 Segment: ~65 seconds (trimmed from 75)
- W3 Segment: ~75 seconds (expanded slightly for climax)
- CTA: ~20 seconds

---

## EDITOR ASSEMBLY NOTES

1. **Music**: Single continuous track across all three segments. Select track that builds—starts chill (W1 morning), intensifies (W2 comparison), peaks (W3 transformation).

2. **Color Grade**: Match all three winners to consistent grade. W3 may need adjustment if shot in different lighting.

3. **Text Overlays**: Use consistent font/style. Add key stats as text reinforcement at checkpoints.

4. **B-Roll**: Can add supplementary B-roll at transitions to smooth cuts. Gym footage, product shots, lifestyle imagery.

5. **Audio Levels**: Ensure consistent levels across all speakers. Original winners may have different mixing.

6. **Pacing**: W1 can be slightly slower (lifestyle). W2 should feel energetic (comparison). W3 should build to emotional peak.

---

## A/B TEST VARIATIONS

**Variation A** (recommended): W1 → W2 → W3 (lifestyle → logic → emotion)

**Variation B**: W3 → W2 → W1 (authority → logic → lifestyle aspiration)

**Variation C**: W1 → W3 → W2 (lifestyle → emotion → logic close)

**Hook Tests**:
- Original W1 hook vs. W2 hook as opener
- Combined hook: "5:14 AM, 3 years into my fitness journey, and I finally found the protein that changed everything."

# WINNER STACKING ASSEMBLY BRIEF: SLEEP SUPPLEMENT SUPER-CREATIVE

## WINNER COMPONENT ANALYSIS

### Winner 1: "I Was a Chronic Insomniac" (2 min)
**Hook (0-10s)**: "I haven't slept through the night in 11 years. Until 6 weeks ago."
**Problem/Setup (10-60s)**: Detailed insomnia journey—tried everything, impact on life, marriage, career
**Product Introduction (60-80s)**: Discovery, skepticism, first try
**Proof Points (80-105s)**: Week-by-week improvement, specific sleep metrics
**CTA (105-120s)**: Emotional appeal with link

**Why It Won**: Extended problem agitation—audience deeply relates. Transformation is dramatic.

### Winner 2: "Doctor Explains Why Melatonin Doesn't Work" (90s)
**Hook (0-8s)**: "Melatonin is the most misunderstood sleep aid. Here's what actually works."
**Problem/Setup (8-35s)**: Why melatonin fails—mechanism explanation, tolerance buildup
**Product Introduction (35-55s)**: Alternative approach, different mechanism
**Proof Points (55-80s)**: Clinical backing, ingredient breakdown
**CTA (80-90s)**: Authority-based recommendation

**Why It Won**: Education + authority. Speaks to frustrated melatonin users (huge audience).

### Winner 3: "My Husband Noticed First" (60s)
**Hook (0-8s)**: "My husband asked me what changed. I didn't know what he meant."
**Problem/Setup (8-20s)**: Didn't realize how bad her sleep had gotten until improvement
**Product Introduction (20-30s)**: Brief mention of starting supplement
**Proof Points (30-50s)**: Third-party observations—energy, mood, presence
**CTA (50-60s)**: Relationship angle close

**Why It Won**: Emotional proof through external observation. Unexpected format. High ROAS (4.5).

## REDUNDANCY ELIMINATION MAP

| Element | Winner 1 | Winner 2 | Winner 3 | Action |
|---------|----------|----------|----------|--------|
| Main Hook | ✓ (11 years) | ✓ (Melatonin myth) | ✓ (Husband) | W1 opens, W2 re-hooks |
| Problem Setup | ✓✓✓ (detailed) | ✓ (mechanism) | ✓ (brief) | W1 carries problem weight |
| Product Intro | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | Single intro after W1 |
| Mechanism/Science | Implied | ✓✓✓ | None | W2 owns science section |
| Transformation | ✓✓ | None | ✓ (observed) | W1 personal, W3 external |
| CTA | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ELIMINATE, single close |

**Redundancies to Remove**:
- W1 CTA (105-120s) → Remove entirely
- W2 CTA (80-90s) → Remove entirely
- W2 product intro → Trim (product already known from W1)
- W3 product intro → Skip entirely
- W3 problem setup → Minimize (problem well-established)

---

## OPTIMAL SEQUENCE RATIONALE

**Recommended Order: Winner 1 → Winner 2 → Winner 3**

**Why This Sequence Works**:

1. **Winner 1 Opens**: The 11-year insomnia hook is POWERFUL. It immediately qualifies the audience (people who struggle with sleep) and establishes high stakes. The extended problem setup builds emotional investment.

2. **Winner 2 Middle**: After emotional connection, provide LOGICAL validation. "Here's WHY what you've tried hasn't worked." Doctor authority adds credibility. Explains the mechanism without introducing new emotional story.

3. **Winner 3 Closes**: External observation provides unexpected proof angle. After personal story (W1) and science (W2), third-party validation from husband is emotionally compelling close. "Even other people noticed."

**Key Insight**: This follows the classic Emotional → Logical → Emotional structure that high-performing long-form ads use.

---

## COMPLETE STACKED STRUCTURE

### OPENING SEGMENT: The Insomnia Journey (from Winner 1)
**0:00-0:10** - Original W1 hook: "I haven't slept through the night in 11 years. Until 6 weeks ago."
**0:10-1:00** - W1 problem journey FULL (this is the gold—don't cut)
- Trying everything: melatonin, sound machines, sleep apps
- Impact: marriage strain, work performance, health
- Emotional low point
**1:00-1:20** - W1 discovery and skepticism
**1:20-1:40** - W1 first results, initial improvement
**1:40-2:00** - W1 week-by-week transformation (keep specific metrics)
**2:00** - REMOVE W1 CTA, cut before link mention

**Transition Note**: "But I wanted to understand WHY this worked when everything else failed..."

### MIDDLE SEGMENT: The Science Explanation (from Winner 2)
**2:00-2:08** - W2 hook MODIFIED: "So I asked a sleep specialist. What she told me changed everything I thought I knew about sleep supplements."
**2:08-2:35** - W2 melatonin mechanism debunk (keep—validates W1's failed attempts)
**2:35-3:00** - W2 alternative mechanism explanation
**3:00-3:20** - W2 ingredient/clinical backing (condensed)
**3:20** - REMOVE W2 CTA entirely

**Transition Note**: "And I wasn't the only one who noticed the difference..."

### CLOSING SEGMENT: External Validation (from Winner 3)
**3:20-3:28** - W3 hook: "A few weeks in, my husband asked me what changed. I didn't even know what he meant."
**3:28-3:45** - W3 external observations (energy, mood, presence)
**3:45-4:00** - W3 relationship impact (can expand slightly)
**4:00-4:15** - Social proof expansion (can add 1-2 additional testimonial snippets)
**4:15-4:35** - COMBINED CTA

### CLOSING CTA STRUCTURE (4:15-4:35)
"After 11 years [W1 callback], I finally understood why nothing worked [W2 callback]—and the people around me noticed before I did [W3 callback]. If you're ready to actually sleep again, link in bio. Use code SLEEP for 20% off your first order. It changed everything for me. Maybe it will for you too."

---

## TRANSITION INSTRUCTIONS

**Transition 1 (W1→W2 at 2:00)**:
- Audio: Contemplative pause, curiosity inflection
- Visual: Can cut to doctor/clinical setting, or use "searching for answers" B-roll
- Script bridge: "But I wanted to understand WHY..." OR "I needed to know what made this different..."

**Transition 2 (W2→W3 at 3:20)**:
- Audio: Shift from educational to personal/emotional tone
- Visual: Cut from clinical to home environment
- Script bridge: "And the science made sense. But the real proof came from somewhere I didn't expect..." OR direct cut to W3 hook

**Music Guidance**: 
- W1: Melancholic but hopeful undertone
- W2: Neutral, slightly clinical
- W3: Warm, emotional resolution
- Single track that evolves through these moods ideal

---

## ENGAGEMENT CHECKPOINT PLACEMENTS

| Timestamp | Checkpoint | Action |
|-----------|------------|--------|
| 0:30 | Deep in problem | Ensure emotional engagement maintained |
| 1:00 | Problem peak | Most emotional moment of journey |
| 1:30 | Transformation beginning | Hope introduction |
| 2:00 | Transition | Pattern interrupt: new voice (doctor) |
| 2:30 | Education peak | Key mechanism insight |
| 3:00 | Re-hook | Tease external validation coming |
| 3:30 | Emotional close | Husband observation reveal |
| 4:00 | Pre-CTA | Social proof stack |

---

## CTA STRATEGY

**Mid-Video CTAs**: REMOVED entirely. The long-form narrative requires uninterrupted flow.

**Soft CTA Option**:
- **At 2:00** (before W2): Very brief text overlay with website URL only—no verbal callout
- **Tests capture of viewers who are convinced after W1 alone

**Final CTA (4:15-4:35)**: Extended emotional close
- Callback all three story elements
- Personal recommendation language
- Discount code for tracking
- Open-ended hopeful close ("Maybe it will for you too")

---

## ESTIMATED RUN TIME

**Final Length**: 4:30-4:45

**Breakdown**:
- W1 Segment: ~120 seconds (trimmed slightly from 2 min)
- W2 Segment: ~80 seconds (trimmed from 90)
- W3 Segment: ~60 seconds (can expand slightly)
- CTA: ~25 seconds

---

## EDITOR ASSEMBLY NOTES

1. **Pacing Critical**: W1 can breathe—let the emotional moments land. W2 should feel more energetic/informative. W3 returns to emotional pacing.

2. **B-Roll Opportunities**:
   - W1: Night scenes, clock shots, exhaustion imagery
   - W2: Supplement bottles, clinical imagery, brain/sleep graphics
   - W3: Couple moments, morning energy, daily life

3. **Audio**: W1 may have been recorded in different environment than W2. Normalize levels carefully. Consider re-recording transitions for consistency.

4. **Text Overlays**: 
   - W1: "11 years of insomnia" stat reinforcement
   - W2: Key mechanism points as text
   - W3: "What he noticed" bullet points

5. **Emotional Arc**: Build to emotional peak at W3 husband reveal. This should feel like the payoff of the entire journey.

---

## A/B TEST VARIATIONS

**Variation A** (recommended): W1 → W2 → W3 (emotion → logic → emotion)

**Variation B**: W2 → W1 → W3 (education hook → personal story → validation)
- May work better for highly skeptical audience who needs logic first

**Variation C**: W3 hook → W1 → W2 → W3 close
- Opens with curiosity (husband noticed), then full story
- Tests intrigue-first approach

**Length Test**: 
- Full version (4:30)
