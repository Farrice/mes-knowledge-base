**2. Confessional → Tactical**
"I'm about to admit something embarrassing: For three years, I let clients set my rates. Every single one. I thought it was being flexible. It was being a coward. Here's what changed..."

**3. Contrast scene → Teaching**
"My competitor charges $20,000 for the same thing I used to charge $2,000 for. She's booked solid. I was begging for leads. The difference wasn't the work. It was one sentence in her proposal..."
