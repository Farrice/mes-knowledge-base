## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

**Context**: Tech thriller, antagonist is activist targeting AI company

### ANTAGONIST: David Moreno

**Basic Role**: Hacker exposing AI company's surveillance systems

**ORIGIN WOUND**
David's younger sister was denied bail after an AI risk-assessment algorithm flagged her as "flight risk." She was nineteen. First offense, nonviolent. She spent eleven months in jail awaiting trial, lost her scholarship, and attempted suicide. The charges were eventually dropped. The AI was never held accountable. No one apologized.

**VALID CRITIQUE**
The company's AI systems ARE being used by courts, schools, and employers to make life-altering decisions about real people. The training data IS biased. The algorithms ARE opaque. David isn't wrong about any of this.

**SOUND LOGIC**
"If I expose their data practices, they'll have to change. If I embarrass them publicly, regulators will act. If I don't do something, what happened to Maria will happen to thousands of other kids. The system won't fix itself, so someone has to break it."

**SYMPATHETIC MOMENT**
*Scene: David visits Maria in the hospital, three months post-suicide attempt*

She was drawing something on the hospital-issue notepad. Flowers, maybe. The kind of thing a kindergartner would draw. 

"Do you remember my scholarship?" she asked without looking up.

"Yeah."

"I dreamed about it last night. I was on campus. I was happy." She kept drawing. "Then I woke up here."

David took her hand. The bandages on her wrists had been changed that morning. Clean. Clinical. Everything under control.

"I'm going to make them pay," he said.

She looked at him then. Didn't argue. Just nodded.

"Good."

**BREAKING POINT**
David's breaking point comes when he decides that exposing the company isn't enough—he needs to destroy it. The moment he releases unredacted user data, exposing innocent employees and customers along with the executives, he crosses from whistleblower to criminal. His cause was right; his final action wasn't.
