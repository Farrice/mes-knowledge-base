### OPENING CHAPTER

*[PROXIMITY TENSION]* Dr. Sarah Chen was staring at the gun in her patient's hand when her phone buzzed with a text from her daughter. *Tuesday reminder: School pickup 3pm*

*[SENSORY ANCHOR]* The office smelled like the lavender diffuser she'd bought to calm clients. It wasn't working. The leather chair creaked as Marcus shifted. The gun—compact, black, real—caught light from the window she should have curtained.

*[CHARACTER THROUGH CHOICE]* "Marcus," she said, keeping her voice in the register she'd perfected. "I'm going to keep my hands where you can see them. And I'm going to ask you a question that might sound strange."

He didn't answer. His finger wasn't on the trigger—she noticed that. Noticed she'd noticed.

*[MICRO MYSTERY #1]* "Do you know who I am?" she asked. "Who I really am?"

*[CONTRAST]* The question surprised him. She watched his face shift—the gun had given him all the power, but now something had taken some back. Twenty years of training, or something else?

*[MICRO MYSTERY #2]* She didn't wait for his answer. "Because I need to know whether you're here because of what I've told you—" she gestured at the room, the diplomas, the careful fiction of Dr. Sarah Chen, "—or because of what I did before."

*[SENSORY DEEPEN]* The clock on her desk—analog, chosen because digital felt cold—ticked through three seconds of silence.

*[EMOTIONAL RESONANCE]* Marcus's hand was shaking. Not the hand with the gun—the other one, pressed against his thigh like he was holding himself in place. She recognized that tremor. She'd felt it herself, once, staring at a man who wouldn't wake up.

*[CHARACTER DEPTH]* "You know something about me," Marcus said finally. "Something you shouldn't know."

*[REVELATION + NEW MYSTERY]* Sarah nodded. "I know what you did in Phoenix. And I know why you think you had to do it."

The gun lowered an inch.

*[MOMENTUM ENDING]* "I'm not here to stop you," she said. "I'm here because I need your help to do it again."

### ELEMENT ANALYSIS

| Element | Where | Effect |
|---------|-------|--------|
| Proximity | First line | Immediate stakes |
| Sensory | Lavender, leather, clock | Reality grounding |
| Character/Choice | "Who I really am" | Mystery about protagonist |
| Contrast | Therapist / dangerous past | Juxtaposition |
| Micro Mystery | Two mysteries layered | Forward pull |
| Emotional | The tremor, shared recognition | Connection |
| Momentum | "Do it again" | Chapter end hook |

### TRANSITION TO CHAPTER 2

Chapter 2 can go to: (a) flashback to "what she did before," (b) continue the conversation, or (c) cut to a different timeline. All work because the mystery is now too strong to abandon.
