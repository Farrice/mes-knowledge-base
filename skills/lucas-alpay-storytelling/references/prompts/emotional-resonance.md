## ROLE & ACTIVATION

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **Identify the specific moment** — Get granular
2. **Find the universal beneath** — What do all humans know about this?
3. **Ground in physical sensation** — Emotion lives in the body
4. **Don't name the feeling** — Show, don't tell
5. **Connect to reader's own experience** — They feel their version of this

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

**Context**: Adult child visiting aging parent

### RESONANCE PASSAGE

His mother had gotten smaller. That was the first thing Tom noticed—not the obvious signs, the walker in the corner or the pill organizer on the kitchen table, but the way she seemed to occupy less space in the doorframe. As if she'd started the slow process of disappearing.

She hugged him too tight, the way she always did, and for a moment he was ten years old again, skinned knee, her arms the safest place in the world. Then she let go, and she was old again, and he was forty-three, and the kitchen smelled like the casserole she'd made him every birthday because she'd never quite accepted that he'd grown up and stopped liking tuna.

"You look thin," she said. "Are you eating?"

"Mom, I'm fine."

"You're not fine. I'm your mother. I know when you're not fine."

She didn't know, of course. She couldn't. There was too much he'd never told her and too much time lost and too many careful lies built up like scar tissue between them. But standing in that kitchen that hadn't changed since 1987, smelling that casserole he didn't have the heart to tell her he wouldn't eat, he wanted her to be right. Wanted her to see through him, just one more time.

**RESONANCE ANALYSIS**:
- **Universal**: Watching parents age, wanting to be known
- **Physical grounding**: "Smaller," "too tight," smell of casserole
- **Not named**: Love, grief, regret—none stated, all felt
- **Reader bridge**: Everyone who's watched a parent change
