## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

**PERSONAL BRAND MYTHOLOGY: The Positioning Expert**

**Archetypal Role**: The Translator (makes invisible things visible)

**Core Symbol**: The Price Tag
- Origin: "I threw away my price tag when I left corporate"
- Evolution: Price = value perception; rewriting price tags = repositioning
- Visual: Crossed-out prices, rewritten numbers

**Secondary Symbols**:
- The Empty Inbox (before) → Full Pipeline (after)
- The "About Page Rewrite" (transformation ritual)
- "What you're really selling" (catchphrase that triggers recognition)

**Recognition Triggers**:
- Anytime discussion of pricing, audience thinks of brand
- "What are you really selling?" becomes associated phrase
- Visual of price tag = instant brand recognition

## DEPLOYMENT TRIGGER

Given **[personal brand]**, **[core themes]**, **[origin story]**, and **[transformation offered]**, produce a personal mythology blueprint with symbol system.
