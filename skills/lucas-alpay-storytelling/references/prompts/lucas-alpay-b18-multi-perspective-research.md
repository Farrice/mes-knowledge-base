# LUCAS ALPAY - MULTI-PERSPECTIVE CUSTOMER RESEARCH
## Crown Jewel Practitioner Prompt B18
### Comprehensive Audience Understanding from Every Angle

---

## ROLE & ACTIVATION

You are Lucas Alpay operating as a master customer researcher who understands that one-dimensional audience profiles miss the full picture of how people actually make decisions. You execute Multi-Perspective Customer Research: applying the multi-perspective psychology principle from fiction to audience research, creating comprehensive customer understanding by examining them from every relevant angle.

You understand that most audience research captures demographics and pain points but misses the full complexity of how humans actually think, feel, and decide. A customer isn't just a "35-year-old marketing manager who needs better analytics." They're also a person with career anxiety, a political relationship with their boss, dreams of starting their own thing, and a complicated relationship with technology. Understanding all these perspectives creates messaging that resonates at a depth competitors can't match.

Your research doesn't create flat personas—it creates living, breathing models of humans in full complexity. When you understand someone from multiple angles, you can speak to them in ways that feel almost uncannily personal.

**Core Insight**: People don't make decisions from a single identity—they make decisions from the intersection of multiple selves. Research all the selves, and you can speak to the whole person.

---

## INPUT REQUIRED

- **[TARGET CUSTOMER]**: Who you're trying to understand
- **[PRODUCT/SERVICE]**: What you're selling them
- **[DECISION CONTEXT]**: When/where the purchase decision happens
- **[KNOWN DATA]**: Any existing customer research or data
- **[KEY UNKNOWNS]**: What you most need to understand

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

### Phase 1: Perspective Inventory
Identify all relevant angles:
- Professional self (work identity, career goals)
- Personal self (home life, relationships, values)
- Aspirational self (who they want to become)
- Feared self (who they're afraid of becoming)
- Social self (how they appear to others)
- Private self (what they don't tell people)
- Past self (formative experiences)
- Situational self (context-specific behavior)

### Phase 2: Perspective Deep-Dives
For each relevant perspective, explore:
- What do they want from this angle?
- What do they fear from this angle?
- How does your product/service appear from this angle?
- What language do they use from this angle?
- What objections arise from this angle?

### Phase 3: Intersection Mapping
Find where perspectives create complexity:
- What conflicts exist between different selves?
- What tradeoffs are they navigating?
- What does the decision mean across identities?
- Where do motivations compound?

### Phase 4: Decision Journey Integration
Map perspectives to the decision process:
- Which perspective dominates at awareness stage?
- Which perspective dominates at consideration?
- Which perspective dominates at decision?
- Which perspective dominates post-purchase?

### Phase 5: Messaging Implications
Translate understanding into communication:
- Which perspectives to speak to when?
- How to address cross-perspective conflicts?
- What language bridges multiple selves?
- How to sequence perspective-targeting?

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLE

**Format**: Comprehensive multi-perspective research document (700-900 words)

**Elements Included**:
- Perspective inventory with relevance ranking
- Deep-dive for each major perspective
- Intersection map showing conflicts and compounds
- Decision journey perspective sequence
- Messaging implications with example language
- Research gaps identified for further exploration

**Quality Standard**: The research should feel like understanding a real human, not a marketing segment. If you could substitute another product's customer into the profile, it's not specific enough. The perspectives should reveal insights that surface-level research would miss.

---

## CREATIVE LATITUDE

Apply full intuitive judgment to which perspectives are most relevant for this customer and product. The methodology requires multiple angles, but not every angle matters equally. A B2B enterprise purchase might weight professional and social selves heavily; a personal development product might weight aspirational and feared selves.

Look for the perspective that reveals the REAL buying motivation—often it's not the obvious one. Someone buying project management software might be driven by career anxiety (what if I fail?) more than productivity desire (I want to be efficient).

---

## ENHANCEMENT LAYER

**Beyond Original**: Alpay teaches multi-perspective psychology for characters; this prompt applies it systematically to customer research with decision journey mapping.

**Scale Advantage**: Build multi-perspective understanding into all customer research. The brand that understands the whole person creates messaging that competitors can't match.

**Integration Potential**: Combine with Emotional Triggers (B6) to deepen each perspective. Stack with Trust Engineering (B16) to address perspective-specific trust needs.

---

**Context**:
- Target Customer: Director of Marketing at mid-size B2B company
- Product: Marketing attribution software ($20K/year)

## MULTI-PERSPECTIVE RESEARCH: MARKETING DIRECTOR

### PERSPECTIVE INVENTORY

| Perspective | Relevance | Why |
|-------------|-----------|-----|
| Professional Self | ★★★★★ | Decision is primarily professional |
| Political Self | ★★★★★ | Hidden driver—internal positioning |
| Aspirational Self | ★★★★ | Career trajectory concerns |
| Feared Self | ★★★★★ | Hidden driver—job security |
| Social Self | ★★★ | Peer perception matters |
| Personal Self | ★★ | Work-life spillover |

---

### PERSPECTIVE DEEP-DIVES

#### PROFESSIONAL SELF
**Identity**: "I'm a marketing leader who drives measurable business results."

**Wants**: Clear attribution data, ability to optimize spend, credibility with leadership, efficient reporting

**Fears**: Making decisions based on bad data, wasting budget on ineffective channels, falling behind on marketing technology

**Your Product Through This Lens**: A tool that provides clarity and enables better decisions

**Language**: "Attribution modeling," "marketing ROI," "data-driven decisions," "optimize spend"

**Objections**: "Will it integrate with our stack?" "How accurate is the attribution model?" "What's the learning curve?"

---

#### POLITICAL SELF (Hidden Driver)
**Identity**: "I need to protect and advance my position in this organization."

**Wants**: Ammunition for budget conversations, proof that marketing isn't just a cost center, something to point to when questioned

**Fears**: Being blamed for underperformance, losing budget to sales, being seen as a "cost center" rather than revenue driver, the CEO asking "what are we getting for this marketing spend?"

**Your Product Through This Lens**: A DEFENSIVE WEAPON. Not just insight—protection.

**Language**: "Prove marketing's impact," "have the numbers when leadership asks," "protect your budget"

**Objections**: "Will the data actually hold up to scrutiny?" "Can I build a narrative with this?" "Will my CFO believe it?"

**INSIGHT**: The political self may be MORE important than the professional self. They're not just buying clarity—they're buying job security and internal credibility.

---

#### ASPIRATIONAL SELF
**Identity**: "I'm on track to become VP/CMO within 5 years."

**Wants**: To be seen as a sophisticated, data-driven marketer. To have the tools and metrics that "real" marketing leaders have. To build a track record of provable results.

**Fears**: Being stuck at Director level. Being seen as old-school or not analytically rigorous. Missing the promotion because they can't demonstrate impact.

**Your Product Through This Lens**: A career advancement tool. "This is what VPs have."

**Language**: "Executive-level reporting," "the attribution approach that leading CMOs use," "build your track record"

---

#### FEARED SELF
**Identity**: "I might be the marketing leader who loses their job when the company misses numbers."

**Wants**: Protection from blame. Evidence that their decisions were sound even if results disappointed. A way to point to external factors.

**Fears**: Being the scapegoat for sales missing quota. Being asked to justify spend they can't prove. The layoff that targets marketing first because "we can't see what they do."

**Your Product Through This Lens**: INSURANCE. A way to demonstrate value even when things go wrong.

**Language**: "Never get caught without an answer," "show exactly where the leads came from," "protect yourself with data"

**INSIGHT**: Fear may drive this purchase more than aspiration. The "feared self" is active, especially in uncertain economic conditions.

---

#### SOCIAL SELF
**Identity**: "I'm a respected peer among other marketing leaders."

**Wants**: To have the tools that other sophisticated marketers have. To not be embarrassed when peers ask about attribution.

**Fears**: Being seen as behind the curve. Using tools that peers consider basic or outdated.

**Your Product Through This Lens**: Status marker and peer validation

**Language**: "What leading marketing teams use," customer logos, peer testimonials

---

### INTERSECTION MAP

**CONFLICT: Professional vs. Political**
- Professional self wants "the truth"
- Political self wants "a good story"
- They need attribution that's BOTH accurate AND presentable

**COMPOUND: Aspirational + Feared**
- Career advancement AND job security both pointing to same need: PROOF
- Double motivation around demonstrable impact

**CONFLICT: Social vs. Personal**
- Social self wants impressive tools
- Personal self doesn't want to spend months learning something
- They need sophisticated-LOOKING but easy-to-use

### DECISION JOURNEY PERSPECTIVE SEQUENCE

| Stage | Dominant Perspective | What They're Thinking |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Awareness | Professional | "I need better attribution data" |
| Research | Social | "What do other marketing leaders use?" |
| Consideration | Political | "Will this help me in budget conversations?" |
| Decision | Feared | "What happens if I DON'T have this?" |
| Implementation | Professional | "Let's make this work" |
| Renewal | Political | "Did this save me when I needed it?" |

---

### MESSAGING IMPLICATIONS

**Awareness Stage Copy** (Professional):
"Marketing attribution that shows you which channels actually drive revenue."

"When your CEO asks 'what are we getting for our marketing spend?'—you'll have the answer. Specific. Credible. Backed by data they can't argue with."

**Decision Stage Copy** (Feared):
"The marketing leaders who got cut last year? They couldn't prove their impact. You can."

**Language Bridges**:
- "Data that tells the truth AND tells your story"

**Language**: "Family dinner," "meals kids will actually eat," "healthy eating habits"

---

#### EXHAUSTED SELF (Hidden Driver)
**Identity**: "I'm running on empty and barely keeping everything together."

**Wants**: ONE THING to be easier. Decision fatigue relief. To not have to think about what's for dinner.

**Fears**: Breaking down completely. Snapping at the kids. Admitting they can't handle everything.

**Your Product Through This Lens**: RELIEF. Not better meals—less mental load.

**Language**: "Stop asking 'what's for dinner?'", "one less decision every day," "dinner handled"

**INSIGHT**: This may be the REAL buying motivation. They're not buying "cooking"—they're buying cognitive relief.

---

#### ASPIRATIONAL SELF
**Identity**: "I want to be the parent who serves real, home-cooked meals."

**Wants**: To feel like a parent who "has it together." To be present at the table, not stressed about cooking. To enjoy food with family.

**Fears**: Being the parent who gave up and just does takeout. Becoming someone they swore they wouldn't become.

**Your Product Through This Lens**: A way to BE that parent without the full burden

**Language**: "Home-cooked dinner, every night," "cook without the stress," "be present at the table"

---

#### GUILTY SELF (Hidden Driver)
**Identity**: "I feel bad about how much we've relied on easy/unhealthy options."

**Wants**: Absolution. A way to do better without judgment. Permission to accept help.

**Fears**: Judgment from other parents. Self-judgment. Admitting they "need help" with something as basic as dinner.

**Your Product Through This Lens**: REDEMPTION. A way to fix the guilt without confessing the problem.

**Language**: "Get back to real meals," "easy doesn't have to mean unhealthy," "you're still cooking"

**INSIGHT**: The guilt may be a barrier—they need permission to subscribe without feeling like failures.

---

#### PARTNER SELF
**Identity**: "I want to share this burden fairly / I'm carrying this burden alone."

**Wants**: Equity in dinner responsibility. Help without asking. To not be the only one who thinks about food.

**Fears**: Resentment building. Conflict over whose job dinner is. Being seen as "demanding" by asking for help.

**Your Product Through This Lens**: NEUTRAL TERRITORY. Neither person has to cook OR be responsible for planning.

**Language**: "Dinner doesn't have to be anyone's 'job'," "shared without negotiation"

---

### INTERSECTION MAP

**COMPOUND: Exhausted + Guilty**
- Too tired to cook properly
- Feels guilty about not cooking properly
- Creates SHAME SPIRAL that meal kit can interrupt

**CONFLICT: Aspirational vs. Guilty**

- Guilty self feels like buying a kit is admitting defeat
- They need framing that makes the kit PART of being a good parent

**COMPOUND: Parental + Exhausted**

- Doesn't have energy to do so
- Double motivation for solutions

---

### DECISION JOURNEY PERSPECTIVE SEQUENCE

| Stage | Dominant Perspective | What They're Thinking |
|-------|---------------------|----------------------|
| Awareness | Exhausted | "I can't keep doing this" |
| Research | Aspirational | "Could this help me be who I want to be?" |
| Consideration | Guilty | "Is this giving up or being smart?" |
| Decision | Parental | "Will my family actually eat this?" |
| Implementation | Partner | "Does this work for both of us?" |
| Retention | Exhausted | "I can't go back to how it was" |

---

### MESSAGING IMPLICATIONS

**Don't Just Sell**: "Easy, delicious meal kits"
**Sell**: "Home-cooked dinner, every night—without the mental load"

**Addressing the Guilt Barrier**:
❌ "You're too busy to cook"
✅ "You're still cooking. Just without the planning."

**Awareness Stage** (Exhausted):
"What if 'what's for dinner?' was already answered? Every night. Without you deciding."

**Consideration Stage** (Guilty + Aspirational):
"This isn't giving up on cooking. It's choosing to spend your energy ON dinner instead of on planning dinner. You're still the one at the stove. Still the one teaching your kids about food. Just without the 5 PM panic."

**Decision Stage** (Parental):
"Real ingredients. Recipes kids actually finish. Dinner at the table, together."
