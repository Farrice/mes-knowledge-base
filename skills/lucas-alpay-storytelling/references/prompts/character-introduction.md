### CHARACTER INTRODUCTION

Dr. Elena Vasquez was already scrubbed in when the OR nurse told her the patient's name.

"That's the man who killed my sister," she said. And kept scrubbing.

The nurse froze. "Should I—do you want Dr. Reeves to—"

"He's the best neurosurgeon in the building, but he's in surgery for another four hours. This man has maybe thirty minutes." Elena held up her hands, examined them in the surgical light. Steady. "Tell the team I'm ready."

Only when the doors swung open and she saw his face—older now, grayer, still wearing the same cheap gold watch he'd worn in the courtroom—did her hands begin to shake. She clenched them once. Breathed. And reached for the scalpel.

**INTRODUCTION ANALYSIS**:
- **Reveal through decision**: She chooses to operate on her sister's killer
- **Trait demonstrated**: Moral integrity over personal feelings
- **Reader inference**: This woman has principles that cost her
- **Physical last**: We see her hands, the watch, but character came first
- **No explanation**: We aren't told she's principled—we see it
