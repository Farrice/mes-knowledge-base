## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **Anchor in space** — Establish setting with sensory specificity
2. **Enter in action** — Start mid-moment, not approaching
3. **Layer character** — Reveal through choice and observation
4. **Build tension** — Calibrated beat by beat
5. **Close with momentum** — Something resolved, something opened

---

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLE

**Complete scene** with:
- Full prose (500-1000 words)
- Element annotations
- Purpose achievement analysis

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT
