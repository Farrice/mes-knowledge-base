**Context**: Premium consulting firm

### BRAND MEMORY ARCHITECTURE

**VISUAL ANCHORS**
- Color: Specific deep navy (not just "blue")—#0A1628
- Typography: Weight of authority—always heavy, never thin
- Space: More white space than competitor comfortable. Confidence in emptiness.

**AUDIO ANCHORS**
- Tone: Low male voice in all videos—calm, measured, never enthusiastic
- Pacing: Slower than instinct suggests. Let sentences breathe.
- Signature phrase ending: "The work speaks." (Always end presentations this way)

**TACTILE ANCHORS (Physical Touchpoints)**
- Business cards: Heavier stock than expected—physical weight = gravitas
- Proposal covers: Matte, soft-touch finish—expensive feel without gloss
- Digital equivalent: Slow page transitions—premium apps don't hurry

**EXPERIENTIAL ANCHORS**
- Coffee served in first meetings: Always particular brand, served in specific cups
- Meeting room: Always dimmer lighting than expected—intimacy, focus
- Follow-ups: Always early morning—"they think about me first thing"

### RECALL TEST

"Remember that consulting firm? The one with the navy, the heavy paper, they're always so... measured. Never in a hurry. Made me feel like a real client, not an assembly line."
