## INPUT REQUIRED

- **[MEDIUM]**: Where this appears (social, website, print)

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **Define visual vocabulary** — What visual language fits brand?
2. **Identify meaning carriers** — Objects, spaces, compositions that communicate
3. **Create contrast** — Visual tension that mirrors brand tension
4. **Brief for mood** — Feeling, not just specification
5. **Allow interpretation** — Visual ambiguity = engagement

## EXAMPLE OUTPUT

**VISUAL BRIEF: Premium Positioning Consultant**

**MESSAGE TO COMMUNICATE**:
"Transformation from invisible to unmissable"

**VISUAL VOCABULARY**:
- Empty space = premium, confidence
- Selective focus = clarity of purpose
- Warm light = human, not corporate
- Single objects = decisiveness

**MEANING CARRIERS**:
| Element | Meaning |
|---------|---------|
| Before: Crowded desk | Confusion, commodity |
| After: Single object | Clarity, positioning |
| Transition: Light shift | Transformation moment |

**MOOD DIRECTION**:
"Think modernist photography meets therapy office. Calm but incisive. There's breath in the images. Space to think. Nothing competes for attention. When you see these visuals, you exhale."

**VISUAL TENSION**:
- Simplicity vs. impact
- Empty space vs. powerful presence
- Warmth vs. precision

**AMBIGUITY LAYER**:
"The viewer should wonder: Is this about the work or the person? (Answer: both)"
