### COGNITIVE DISSONANCE COPY

**BEFORE STATE (Vivid)**
Tuesday, 9pm. You're still writing the $150 blog post that took six hours instead of two. Tomorrow there are three more just like it. Your Upwork proposals got 0 responses. The client who said "this is great!" hasn't responded to your invoice in 11 days.

You're working more hours than you did at your 9-to-5. You're making less money. And you can't shake the feeling that everyone else knows something you don't.

**AFTER STATE (Vivid)**
Tuesday, 3pm. You just sent an invoice for $3,200—one project, one week. The client thanked YOU and asked if you're available next month. You have three other prospects waiting.

You don't respond to job posts anymore. They come to you. Your rate isn't "what you can get away with"—it's "the starting point for people who want the best."

Tonight you'll actually stop working. Not because you ran out of energy. Because you're done.

**SIDE-BY-SIDE CONTRAST**

| Then | Now |
|------|-----|
| $150/post | $3,200/project |
| Chasing clients | Turning them down |
| Working 60 hours | Working 30 |
| "What do you charge?" | "My rate is $X. Is that in budget?" |
| Hoping for work | Scheduling work weeks out |
| Imposter syndrome | "They're lucky to have me" |

**THE GAP**

This isn't two different people. This is the same person—you—with different positioning.

The only thing between where you are and where you want to be is learning how to describe what you do in a way that makes $3,200 feel like a bargain.

That's what I teach. The Positioning Shift takes 4 weeks. You'll have a new rate, new pitch, and new clients before month two.
