# Genius Patterns — Lindsay AI Consulting

## Pattern 1: The Robot Speak Elimination
**Execute**: Before sending any outreach, ask "Could this only be sent to THIS person about THIS business?" If no → rewrite.
**Success Metric**: Response rates above 15% (vs. 1-3% average)

## Pattern 2: Revenue-First Positioning
**Execute**: Convert offers: [Technical Capability] → [Business Process] → [Revenue/Lead/Conversion Impact]
**Success Metric**: Prospects ask "how much?" not "why should I care?"

## Pattern 3: Industry Language Absorption
**Execute**: Spend 2 hours in target industry communities before writing ANY outreach. Document exact phrases used.
**Success Metric**: Prospects respond "you get it"

## Pattern 4: Temperature Calibration
**Execute**: Match proof density to channel: Cold email = case study required. Referral = relationship carries weight.
**Success Metric**: Conversion rates appropriate to channel (cold: 2-5%, referral: 40%+)

## Pattern 5: The "Be Approached" Power Dynamic
**Execute**: In communities, share impressive builds without CTA. Let curiosity drive inbound.
**Success Metric**: Inbound messages asking "can you build this for me?"

## Pattern 6: Proof Stacking Without Paid Clients
**Execute**: Document results from ANY build—boss, friend, family, personal. Results are results regardless of payment.
**Success Metric**: 3+ case studies before first paid outreach

## Pattern 7: The 3-Email Maximum
**Execute**: Email 1: specific problem + result. Email 2: case study. Email 3: breakup + simple CTA.
**Success Metric**: Replies on email 1-2, graceful exit on 3

**Execute**: Always position initial conversations as "15-minute quick chat"—never 30-60 minute calls.
**Success Metric**: Higher booking rates, lower no-shows

## Pattern 9: Evergreen Problem Targeting
**Execute**: Ask: "Would businesses pay to solve this in 2019? In 2029?" If yes to both → evergreen.
