## INPUT REQUIRED

- **[AGENT TYPE]**: Purpose and domain
- **[SUCCESS CRITERIA]**: What constitutes good performance
- **[OUTPUT TYPES]**: Text, code, visual, transactional, etc.
- **[EVALUATION RESOURCES]**: Available human evaluators, test data

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **Design User Rating System**: 1-5 star per session with metadata
2. **Create Automated Test Suite**: Verifiable execution tasks
3. **Establish Human Evaluation Protocol**: For aesthetic/subjective outputs
4. **Define Metric Weighting**: How ratings combine into overall score
5. **Build Feedback Loops**: How evaluation drives improvement
6. **Track Trend Analysis**: Performance over time

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLE

A complete Evaluation System Specification containing:
- **User Rating Interface**: How ratings are collected
- **Automated Test Suite**: Task definitions with expected outcomes
- **Human Eval Protocol**: Rubrics for subjective assessment
- **Aggregation Formula**: How metrics combine
- **Dashboard Design**: What gets tracked and displayed
- **Improvement Process**: How insights drive changes
