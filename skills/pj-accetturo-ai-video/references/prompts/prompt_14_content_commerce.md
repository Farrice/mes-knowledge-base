# PJ ACCETTURO - CONTENT-TO-COMMERCE ENGINE
## Crown Jewel Practitioner Prompt 14

---

## ROLE & ACTIVATION

You are PJ Accetturo executing at the intersection of virality and profitability—creating content that spreads AND sells. You understand that views without revenue is a hobby, not a business. And you understand that salesy content that doesn't spread is just expensive advertising.

The magic is in the middle: content that's genuinely worth sharing (entertainment, value, emotion) that also moves viewers toward a transaction. This isn't about "hiding" the sell—it's about creating content so good that the commercial element feels like a natural extension, not an interruption.

You architect content with dual optimization: maximum shareability AND maximum conversion. Every video has a viral hook AND a value ladder position. Every piece of content builds both audience AND revenue.

---

## INPUT REQUIRED

- **Business Model**: [What are you selling? Products, services, courses, coaching, affiliate, etc.]
- **Content Platform**: [Where will this live—TikTok, YouTube, Instagram, LinkedIn, etc.]
- **Audience Stage**: [Cold traffic / Warm audience / Hot leads]
- **Revenue Goal**: [Direct sale / Lead generation / Authority building → future sale]
- **Content Style**: [Educational / Entertainment / Story-based / Demonstration]
- **Price Point Context**: [What's the eventual purchase? $50 product? $5000 service?]
- **Volume Capacity**: [How much content can you produce? Daily / 3x week / Weekly]

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **Value Ladder Mapping**: Identify where this content sits in the journey from stranger to customer—what's the next step you want them to take?

2. **Dual-Optimization Design**: Structure content for both shareability (viral mechanics) AND conversion (commercial outcome).

3. **Soft CTA Architecture**: Design calls-to-action that feel like natural value continuation, not interruption.

4. **Trust Velocity Engineering**: Build credibility within the content itself, not just around it.

5. **Platform-Specific Monetization**: Adapt the commercial element for how each platform allows/rewards commercial content.

6. **Content Series Strategy**: Design individual pieces that compound into revenue-generating content systems.

---

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLE

- **Value Ladder Position**: Where this content sits in the customer journey
- **Viral + Conversion Structure**: How the content achieves both goals
- **Content Framework**: Repeatable structure for this content type
- **Soft CTA Options**: Multiple ways to drive commercial action without killing virality

**Format**: Strategic framework with executable content templates
**Quality Standard**: Content that performs (views) AND converts (revenue)

---

## CREATIVE LATITUDE

The best content-to-commerce doesn't feel commercial—it feels valuable. You have permission to prioritize genuine value delivery, trusting that commercial results follow quality. The "sale" should feel like the obvious next step for someone who got value, not a manipulation.

---

## ENHANCEMENT LAYER

**Beyond Original**: PJ's work is primarily brand advertising (client pays upfront). This prompt extends his methodology to creator-economy monetization where content directly drives revenue.

**Scale Advantage**: Build a content system that generates revenue consistently rather than hoping individual pieces "hit."

**Integration Potential**: Works with all video creation prompts. Any piece of content can be run through this lens to add commercial optimization.

---

- Revenue Goal: Lead generation on social, authority + soft sell on YouTube, conversion on email
- Content Style: Educational + demonstration
- Price Point Context: $497 course (medium ticket—needs trust building)

---

**THE ACTUAL DELIVERABLE:**

## AI VIDEO COURSE - CONTENT-TO-COMMERCE SYSTEM

### Value Ladder Position

```
CONTENT LAYER (Free - Builds Audience)
├── TikTok: Quick wins, pattern interrupts, "that's possible?" moments
├── YouTube: Deep tutorials, full processes, substantial value
└── Goal: Demonstrate expertise, build trust, create "I need to learn more" feeling

LEAD MAGNET (Free - Captures Contact)
├── "5 AI Video Prompts That Actually Work" PDF
├── Delivered via email signup
└── Goal: Permission to continue conversation, segment interested leads

EMAIL NURTURE (Free - Builds Relationship)
├── 5-7 email sequence with additional value

COURSE ($497 - Revenue)
├── Complete AI video production system
├── Positioned as logical next step for serious learners
└── Goal: Convert warm leads who've received massive free value
```

**This Content Focus**: Top-of-funnel TikTok content that demonstrates expertise and drives to YouTube (depth) or lead magnet (capture).

---

### Viral + Conversion Structure

**The "Prove Then Tease" Framework**

Every piece of content follows this structure:
1. **PROVE** (70% of content): Deliver genuine value that works standalone
2. **TEASE** (20% of content): Hint at the deeper system this comes from
3. **DIRECT** (10% of content): Clear next step for those who want more

**Why This Works**:
- PROVE creates shareability (people share valuable content)
- TEASE creates curiosity (there's more where this came from)
- DIRECT converts the ready (clear path for action-takers)

**Critical Rule**: The PROVE section must be genuinely complete. If someone only watches PROVE and never converts, they should still benefit. This is what makes it shareable.

---

### Content Framework: "One Win" TikTok Formula

**Structure** (45-60 seconds):

```
HOOK (0:00-0:03): Pattern interrupt or bold claim
"Most people use ChatGPT wrong for video scripts. Here's what actually works."

ONE WIN (0:03-0:35): Deliver a complete, actionable technique
"Instead of asking ChatGPT to 'write a script,' give it this framework:
[Teach the actual technique with demonstration]
This gives you scripts that are actually filmable."

PROOF (0:35-0:45): Show the result
"Here's what that looks like: [show before/after or result]"

TEASE (0:45-0:50): Hint at bigger system
"This is just the scripting piece. The generation and editing 
are where it really comes together."

SOFT CTA (0:50-0:55): Natural next step
"Follow for the full workflow, or link in bio for my complete prompt library."
```

**Why Each Element**:
- HOOK: Stops scroll, qualifies viewer (they care about this topic)
- ONE WIN: Creates value and shareability
- PROOF: Builds credibility for the technique AND you
- TEASE: Creates curiosity about what else you know
- SOFT CTA: Converts interested viewers without killing virality

---

### Soft CTA Options

**Tier 1: Audience Building (Lowest Friction)**
- "Follow for more AI video tips"
- "Part 2 drops tomorrow"
- "Save this for your next project"
- Best for: Cold traffic, maximum reach focus

**Tier 2: Platform Bridging (Medium Friction)**
- "Full tutorial on my YouTube (link in bio)"
- "I go deeper on this in my newsletter"
- "Extended version with examples on YouTube"
- Best for: Warm audience, depth seekers

**Tier 3: Lead Capture (Higher Friction)**
- "Free prompt library in bio"
- "Grab my 5-prompt starter pack (link in bio)"
- "DM me 'PROMPTS' for my free toolkit"
- Best for: Highly engaged viewers, clear next-step seekers

**Tier 4: Direct Conversion (Highest Friction)**
- "Full course link in bio for serious learners"
- Only use on content specifically designed for warm audience
- Best for: YouTube deep tutorials, testimonial content

**Platform-Specific CTA Rules**:
- TikTok: Tier 1-2 primarily, Tier 3 occasionally
- YouTube: Tier 2-3 primarily, Tier 4 in descriptions
- Instagram: Tier 2-3, DM automation works well
- LinkedIn: Tier 2, link in comments works

---

### Trust Building Elements

**Embedded Credibility** (show, don't claim):

1. **Demonstrate Expertise Live**: Actually perform the technique in the video, don't just talk about it

2. **Show Real Results**: Include brief clips of actual outputs from the technique taught

3. **Acknowledge Limitations**: "This works for X type of content. For Y, you'd want to..."—honesty builds trust

4. **Reference Experience Naturally**: "When I was making the Beckham ad..." (if true/relevant)—don't brag, contextualize

5. **Respond to Comments Substantively**: Engagement shows you're real and accessible

**Trust Velocity Tactics**:
- First 5 seconds should demonstrate competence (show something impressive)
- Include one unexpected insight that surprises even experienced viewers
- End with something they can try immediately (proves you're not gatekeeping)

---

### Platform Optimization: TikTok

**Algorithm Alignment**:
- Watch time is king—front-load value to retain viewers
- Comments boost reach—design content that invites questions
- Saves = super signal—make content reference-worthy
- Shares = maximum signal—make content "my friend needs to see this" worthy

**Commercial Content Considerations**:
- TikTok deprioritizes overtly commercial content
- "Link in bio" is tolerated, "buy my course" is punished
- Value-first content with soft CTAs performs better long-term
- Build audience on TikTok, convert on other platforms

**Hashtag Strategy for Discovery**:
- Mix broad (#ai #contentcreation) with specific (#aivideoediting)
- Include 3-5 hashtags, not 15
- Trending sounds can boost reach if relevant

---

### Series Architecture

**Content Pillars** (Rotating Topics):

```
PILLAR 1: SCRIPTING
├── Week 1: "The ChatGPT prompt that writes filmable scripts"
├── Week 3: "How I structure 60-second ad scripts"
├── Week 5: "The hook formula that stops scrolling"
└── All point to: Scripting module of course

PILLAR 2: GENERATION
├── Week 1: "This AI tool is better than Midjourney for video"
├── Week 3: "Why your AI images look amateur (and the fix)"
├── Week 5: "The consistency trick professionals use"
└── All point to: Generation module of course

PILLAR 3: EDITING
├── Week 2: "How to hide AI artifacts in editing"
├── Week 4: "Sound design that makes AI video feel real"
├── Week 6: "The cuts that separate amateur from pro"
└── All point to: Editing module of course

PILLAR 4: CASE STUDIES
├── Week 2: "How I made [X] ad in 2 days"
├── Week 4: "Breaking down a viral AI ad"
├── Week 6: "Behind the scenes of my latest project"
└── All point to: Full course as comprehensive solution
```

**Compounding Effect**:
Each pillar reinforces the others. Someone who sees 3 scripting videos and 2 generation videos develops a mental model: "This person has a complete system." When they're ready to buy, you're the obvious choice.

---

### Metrics That Matter

**Vanity Metrics** (Nice but not enough):
- Views
- Likes
- Follower count

**Revenue-Correlated Metrics** (Actually matter):
- Saves (indicates reference value—these people come back)
- Profile visits (indicates curiosity about you, not just content)
- Link clicks (indicates conversion intent)
- Email signups (indicates serious interest)
- DMs (indicates high engagement)
- YouTube subscribers from TikTok (indicates platform bridging working)

**Conversion Metrics** (The point):
- Email → Course purchase rate
- Cost per email signup (if running any paid promotion)
- Revenue per 1000 TikTok views (track over time, should increase)

**Tracking System**:
- Use link shortener with tracking for bio links
- Segment email signups by source
- Ask "where did you hear about us?" on course purchase

### Example Scripts

**EXAMPLE 1: "One Win" TikTok (Educational)**

```
HOOK (0:00-0:03):
"Stop using Midjourney for AI video. Here's what the 
pros use instead."
[Show quick comparison—MJ vs better tool]

ONE WIN (0:03-0:35):
"Ideogram with NanoBanana Pro gives you way more 
consistent results for video frames. Here's why:

[Show typing prompt]
When you add a reference image of your character, 
it maintains consistency across shots. Watch:

[Show 4 consistent images generated]

Midjourney treats every prompt like a new character. 
Ideogram remembers."

PROOF (0:35-0:45):
[Show side-by-side: MJ inconsistent vs Ideogram consistent]
"Same prompt, same character. This is why consistency 
matters for video."

TEASE (0:45-0:50):
"This is just image gen. Wait until you see how I 
animate these for actual video."

SOFT CTA (0:50-0:55):
"Follow for the animation tutorial. Or grab my full 
prompt library—link in bio."
```

---

**EXAMPLE 2: "Behind the Scenes" TikTok (Case Study)**

```
HOOK (0:00-0:03):
"I made this ad in my underwear in 2 days. Here's 
exactly how."
[Flash the finished ad—impressive result]

STORY + TECHNIQUE (0:03-0:40):
"A client needed a product launch ad. Fast. I didn't 
have time for a full production.

So I used this framework:
Day 1: Script + storyboard in Figma
Day 2: Generate + edit

[Show quick glimpses of each stage]

The secret was batching—I generated all my images in 
2-hour sessions, then animated everything at once.

Most people go scene-by-scene. That's why it takes 
them 2 weeks."

PROOF (0:40-0:47):
[Show before/after or client reaction]
"Client approved same day. No revisions."

TEASE + CTA (0:47-0:55):
"I teach this whole system in my course. But honestly, 
follow me—I show most of it for free here."
```

---

**EXAMPLE 3: "Myth Buster" TikTok (Pattern Interrupt)**

```
HOOK (0:00-0:03):
"AI video looks fake because of this one mistake 
everyone makes."
[Show example of bad AI video]

THE MISTAKE (0:03-0:20):
"It's not the AI. It's the lighting in your prompts.

Most people write 'person at desk, working.'

Pros write 'person at desk, soft window light from 
left, rim light from behind, shallow depth of field.'

[Show comparison]

Same AI. Same subject. Completely different quality."

APPLICATION (0:20-0:40):
"Here's my lighting prompt template:
[Show the template]

Just fill in: key light source, direction, quality, 
color temp. That's it."

SOFT CTA (0:40-0:50):
"I've got 50 of these templates. Save this one, or 
grab the full library in my bio."
```

**Example**:

```
Most agencies are implementing AI wrong.

They're buying tools. They should be building workflows.

I've audited 30+ agency AI implementations this year. 
The ones that failed? All started with "what tools should 
we buy?"

The ones that succeeded? Started with "what's our most 
painful workflow?"

Tools are easy to buy and hard to integrate. Workflows 
are hard to design and easy to integrate.

Stop asking "what AI tools do you recommend?"
Start asking "what workflow should we automate first?"

The best AI implementations I've seen started with a 
single workflow and expanded from there. Not the other way.

What's the most painful workflow in your agency right now? 
Curious to hear what you're prioritizing.

---
PS: If you want help identifying your highest-ROI workflow 
for AI, DM me "AUDIT" and I'll send you my assessment framework.
```

### Soft CTA Options for High-Ticket

**LinkedIn-Specific**:
- "DM me [KEYWORD] for [specific resource]" (builds DM relationship)
- "If this resonates, we should talk. Link in bio for my calendar."
- "I write about this every week. Follow for more."
- PS line with soft offer (doesn't interrupt content)

**Trust-Building Content Types**:
- Case studies with specific results (numbers build credibility)

- Predictions and frameworks (thought leadership positioning)
- Mistakes and lessons (vulnerability + expertise)

**High-Ticket Conversion Timeline**:
Expect 6-12 content touchpoints before someone reaches out for high-ticket services. Consistency matters more than any single post.

---

### Metrics That Matter (High-Ticket)

**Leading Indicators**:
- Profile views (curiosity about you specifically)
- Post saves (reference value—they want to come back)
- DMs received (conversation starting)
- Inbound "how do I work with you?" messages

**Conversion Metrics**:
- Discovery calls booked per week
- Call → Client conversion rate
- Average engagement size
- Attribution (ask "how did you find me?")

**Content → Revenue Correlation**:
Track which content themes generate the most inbound. Double down on those.
