# Darrel Wilson Hidden Knowledge

5 tacit insights for AI monetization success.

---

## 1. "Anyone Can Do This" Framing
**Insight**: Darrel emphasizes simplicity ("this is really not even a complex workflow") to reduce perceived barriers. Confidence is a conversion factor.

**Deploy**: When teaching or selling systems, explicitly deconstruct complexity and emphasize accessibility.

---

## 2. Problem-Solution Pairing
**Insight**: For every method, Darrel immediately shows the specific problem it solves. He never presents solutions in isolation.

**Deploy**: Always lead with the painful problem before introducing the solution. The gap between pain and relief drives action.

---

## 3. The $29 Psychology
**Insight**: Front-end pricing removes price as an objection entirely. At that level, decision becomes "why not?" rather than "should I?"

**Deploy**: For audience-building offers, price below the threshold of meaningful financial decision-making.

---

## 4. Video-to-Tool Pipeline
**Insight**: Content and tools form an integrated ecosystem. Each video becomes a traffic source for utility tools with monetization.

**Deploy**: Build tools that solve problems discussed in your content. Content drives traffic; tools capture value.

## 5. "Better Than Nothing" Stacking
**Insight**: Darrel doesn't dismiss small wins ($400/month app). He stacks them. Multiple small streams compound into significant income.

**Deploy**: Don't abandon revenue streams because they're "only" generating hundreds per month. Build portfolio of streams.
