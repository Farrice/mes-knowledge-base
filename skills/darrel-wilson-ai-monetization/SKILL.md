# Darrel Wilson AI Monetization

Build AI income systems around demand that already exists—lead generation, affiliate tools, website flipping, and workflow sales.

## Overview

Darrel Wilson is an AI Automation Entrepreneur with 10+ years in web design, now focused on AI monetization systems. His genius: finding people already about to spend money rather than creating demand. He inverts traditional freelancing—pre-building solutions then showing finished products to prospects.

**Core philosophy**: Forget cold blasting. Find people who are already about to spend money.
