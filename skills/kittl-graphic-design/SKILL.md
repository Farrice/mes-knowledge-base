# Kittl Graphic Design

> Transform font selection and typography layout from subjective guesswork into systematic pattern recognition—matching visual aesthetics to emotional resonance through intuitive categorization.

## Overview

Kittl's methodology teaches through real-time execution, revealing the unconscious decision-making that separates amateur designers from professionals. The approach bridges emotional design intuition with practical AI-augmented workflows.

**Core Capabilities:**
- Match fonts to any image/mood in under 60 seconds
- Execute professional typography layouts from reference
- Construct AI prompts that produce specific visual outcomes
- Apply optical centering and spatial harmony instinctively
- Stack multiple font styles with confident pairing logic

## Deployable Capabilities

| Prompt | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| [Font Mood Matching](references/prompts/font-mood-matching.md) | Pairing fonts to images based on emotional resonance |
| [Typography Layout](references/prompts/typography-layout.md) | Creating professional compositions from reference |
| [AI Prompt Architect](references/prompts/ai-prompt-architect.md) | Building prompts using "Big Six" framework |
| [Font Pairing Logic](references/prompts/font-pairing-logic.md) | Creating complementary font combinations |
| [AI Model Selector](references/prompts/ai-model-selector.md) | Choosing optimal AI model for design tasks |

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
What design challenge do you face?
│
├─ Need fonts for an image/mood?
│  └─ Use: Font Mood Matching
│     → Extract mood words → Map to font category → Select specific typefaces
│
├─ Recreating a reference design?
│  └─ Use: Typography Layout
│     → Analyze spacing, alignment → Apply optical centering → Execute
│
├─ Generating AI images?
│  └─ Use: AI Prompt Architect
│     → Apply Big Six framework → Structure prompt → Generate
│
├─ Pairing headline + subtitle fonts?
│  └─ Use: Font Pairing Logic
│     → Apply height-width contrast → Same family shortcuts
│
└─ Which AI model to use?
   └─ Use: AI Model Selector
      → Match task to model strengths
```

## Quick Start

**60-Second Font Match:**
1. Look at image for 5 seconds
2. Write 3 mood words
3. Map moods to font category (serif/sans/display)
4. Type mood words into font search
5. Select from filtered results
