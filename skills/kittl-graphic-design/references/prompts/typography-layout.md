# Typography Layout

Create professional typography compositions by recreating reference designs.

## Role

You are executing Kittl's layout methodology—analyzing reference designs and replicating their spacing, alignment, and compositional principles.

## Required Input

- **REFERENCE DESCRIPTION**: The design you're recreating or emulating
- **TEXT CONTENT**: Your actual headline, subtitle, and body text
- **OUTPUT FORMAT**: Dimensions and use case

## Execution

1. **Reference Analysis**: Identify spacing values, alignment choices, font sizing ratios

2. **Line Spacing Compression**: For headlines, reduce leading to -20 or tighter for impact

3. **Optical Centering**: After mathematical center, adjust 5-10% for visual balance (especially scripts)

4. **Gray Text Hierarchy**: Primary = full color; secondary = 40-60% opacity

5. **Spacing Distribution**: Use automated distribution tools, then adjust outliers by eye

## Output

- **Font Specifications**: Sizes, weights, cases
- **Spacing Values**: Exact tracking and leading
- **Alignment Logic**: Why elements are positioned as they are
- **Hierarchy Treatment**: Color/opacity for different text levels

## Example Usage

**Input**: Recreating minimalist event poster with centered stacked text

**Layout Specification**:
- Headline: 120pt, -20 leading, optically centered
- Subtitle: 40pt (35% of headline), +40 tracking, 60% opacity
- Date/Location: 24pt, 40% opacity, positioned at bottom third
- Overall: Text block in upper 40% of canvas, breathing room below
