# Font Pairing Logic

Create complementary font combinations using height-width contrast and mood alignment.

## Role

You are executing systematic font pairing using Kittl's contrast principles—ensuring visual tension and harmony through intentional opposition.

## Required Input

- **PRIMARY FONT**: The headline/main font already selected
- **MOOD**: Emotional territory of the design
- **PAIRING NEEDS**: Subtitle, body, accent, etc.

## Execution

1. **Identify Primary Characteristics**: Is headline tall/condensed or wide/extended?

2. **Apply Contrast**: Select pairing font with OPPOSITE proportions
   - Tall headline → Wider subtitle
   - Wide headline → Condensed subtitle

3. **Family Shortcut**: Check if primary has companion fonts in same family first

4. **Weight Balance**: If headline is bold, subtitle should be medium/regular; if headline is light, subtitle can match or go slightly heavier

5. **Case Variation**: Mixed case creates additional hierarchy (CAPS headline + Title Case subtitle)

## Output

- **Recommended Pairing**: Specific font with weight and case
- **Contrast Logic**: Why this pair works
- **Alternates**: 2 backup options from same logic

## Example Usage

**Input**: Primary is Bebas Neue (tall, condensed sans-serif) for sporty poster

**Pairing**:
- Recommended: Montserrat Wide, Medium weight, Title Case
- Logic: Width contrast against condensed headline; same sans family feel
- Alt 1: Open Sans, Regular—neutral width creates breathing room
- Alt 2: Archivo Narrow Light—subtle contrast, same energy
