## Pattern 2: Serif/Sans-Serif Mood Mapping
**Execute**: 
- Ethereal/Elegant/Nostalgic/Romantic/Gothic = SERIF first

- Western/Vintage = DISPLAY/DECORATIVE first

**Success Metric**: Correct font category on first attempt 90%+ of time.

## Pattern 3: Height-Width Contrast Pairing
**Execute**: Identify headline font's dominant characteristic (tall/condensed OR wide/extended). Select subtitle font with opposite characteristic.

**Success Metric**: Visual tension and hierarchy immediately apparent.

---

## Pattern 4: Letter Spacing as Mood Amplifier
**Execute**:
- Modern/Tech/Editorial = Tighten tracking (-20 to -60)
- Luxurious/Airy/Minimal = Loosen tracking (+100 to +600)

**Success Metric**: Single tracking adjustment transforms "close" into "perfect."

---

## Pattern 5: Line Spacing Compression

## Pattern 7: Pinterest-to-Execution Training Loop
**Execute**: Daily practice—select 1 reference design, recreate it completely, note what made it work.

**Success Metric**: After 30 days, can execute any typography style within 10 minutes.

---

## Pattern 8: Optical vs. Mathematical Centering
**Execute**: After mathematical centering, ask "Does this LOOK centered?" Adjust by 5-10% if script tails or visual weight create imbalance.

**Success Metric**: Compositions feel balanced without measuring.

---

## Pattern 9: Same-Font-Family Pairing Shortcut
**Execute**: When pairing is difficult, check if headline font has alternate weights, widths, or companion fonts. Pair within family first.

**Success Metric**: Guaranteed visual harmony with minimal risk.

---

## Pattern 10: The Text Shading Technique
**Execute**: For thin fonts: add same-color stroke (offset 0, width 1-2). For dimension: add contrasting shadow (offset 3-5).

**Success Metric**: Fonts gain presence and dimension.

---

## Pattern 11: Gray Text for Visual Hierarchy
**Execute**: Primary text = full color. Secondary text = 40-60% opacity or gray value.

**Success Metric**: Eye naturally flows to important information first.

**Execute**: Shape needs to "cut" into another? Add thick border matching background color instead of complex masking.

**Success Metric**: Complex visual effects in seconds.

---

## Pattern 13: AI Model-to-Task Matching
**Execute**:
- Graphic design with text = Ideogram 2/3
- Photorealistic images = Google Image Gen 4
- Artistic/stylized = Seedream 3/4
- Fast concepting = Flux/Flash
- Image editing = Nana Banana

**Success Metric**: First-generation accuracy increases 60%+.

---

## Pattern 14: The "Big Six" Prompt Architecture
**Execute**: Before prompting, answer: What is it? Where is it? How does it feel? How is it lit? What style? What angle?

**Success Metric**: Prompts produce intended results on first/second generation.

---

## Pattern 15: Technical-First Prompt Structure
**Execute**: Structure as: [Shot type] + [Lighting] + [Subject] + [Setting] + [Style] + [Mood]

**Success Metric**: Consistent visual style across generations.

---

## Pattern 16: Line Break Prompt Separation
**Execute**: After each major element, hit Shift+Enter to create logical separation.

**Success Metric**: AI respects distinct elements rather than blending them.

---

## Pattern 17: Positive Instruction Framing
**Execute**: Reframe every negative as positive. "No clutter" becomes "minimal, clean composition."

**Success Metric**: Fewer unwanted elements; clearer AI interpretation.

---

## Pattern 18: The Emotional Design Vocabulary
**Execute**: Build personal mood vocabulary. When a design "feels right," name that feeling.

**Success Metric**: Can articulate "why" a design works in reproducible terms.
