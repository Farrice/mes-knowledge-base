# Nicolas Cole Genius Patterns

12 unconscious mastery behaviors Cole embeds in every piece of professional writing.

---

## Pattern 1: Terminal Word Power Placement
**Execute**: Before finalizing any sentence, identify the most important word. Restructure so that word lands last. Small words (is, it, why, the) should never end sentences.

**Success Metric**: Final words are nouns or power verbs, never articles or auxiliary verbs.

---

## Pattern 2: Three-Pass Economic Compression
**Execute**: 
- Pass 1: Write the complete thought without editing
- Pass 2: Circle every word under 4 letters; remove as many as possible
- Pass 3: Reorder remaining words for grammatical flow

**Success Metric**: 30-50% word reduction while maintaining full meaning.

---

## Pattern 3: Contraction Introduction Protocol
**Execute**: First mention = full term + (ABBREVIATION). All subsequent mentions = abbreviation only. Never use undefined contractions.

**Success Metric**: Zero undefined contractions; reader never encounters unknown abbreviation.

---

## Pattern 4: Audience Sizing Through Vocabulary
**Execute**: Before writing, define audience size goal. Contractions and jargon = smaller, insider audience. Plain language = broader reach.

**Success Metric**: Vocabulary matches intended audience sophistication level precisely.

---

## Pattern 5: Redundancy Elimination Radar
**Execute**: After each sentence, ask: "Did I already say this?" After each paragraph, ask: "Does this add NEW information?" Delete anything that restates without advancing.

**Success Metric**: Every sentence introduces new information or perspective.

---

## Pattern 6: Word Variation Substitution
**Execute**: Circle any word that appears twice in close proximity. Replace second instance with synonym, related term, or pronoun.

**Success Metric**: No exact word repetition within 2-3 sentences (except intentional emphasis).

---

## Pattern 7: Fourth-Grade Vocabulary Anchoring
**Execute**: Write at fourth-grade level. Add maximum ONE elevated word per sentence or paragraph. More than one = inaccessible.

**Success Metric**: Flesch-Kincaid grade level 4-6 with strategic vocabulary elevations.

---

## Pattern 8: The Two-Comma Rule
**Execute**: Count commas in each sentence. If 3-6, either split into multiple sentences or restructure. 0-2 = controlled. 7+ = intentional stylistic choice.

**Success Metric**: Zero sentences in the 3-6 comma "valley of death."

---

## Pattern 9: Hemingway Adverb Elimination
**Execute**: Search for -ly words. For each, ask: "Is this saying something the verb doesn't already say?" If no, delete. Replace weak verb+adverb with strong single verb.

**Success Metric**: Adverb count reduced by 80%+. "Walked slowly" → "crept."

---

## Pattern 10: Opening Sentence Power
**Execute**: The first sentence of any piece determines whether readers continue. No throat-clearing ("In this article..."). Lead with curiosity, controversy, or specificity.

**Success Metric**: Reader must continue within first 10 words.

---

## Pattern 11: Information Density Optimization
**Execute**: For each paragraph, count sentences delivering NEW information vs. restating/padding. Target ratio: 0.8+ (80% of sentences add new value).

**Success Metric**: Every paragraph advances reader understanding.

---

## Pattern 12: Voice Preservation
**Execute**: Identify voice markers (unusual word choices, rhythm patterns, personality quirks) before optimizing. Protect these even when they violate "rules."

**Success Metric**: Reader familiar with author cannot tell text was edited—except it's better.
