# Implementation Pathway

Three timelines for deploying Mitch Albom's storytelling mastery.

---

## 24-Hour Quickstart

**Hour 0-2: Foundation Lock**
- Read genius patterns completely
- Select your first project
- Write theme statement in under 10 words
- Write your ending (even roughly)

**Hour 2-6: Architecture Build**
- Create your tether statement
- Map protagonist's beginning → ending state
- Outline 3-5 transformation beats
- Ensure every beat serves theme

**Hour 6-12: First Draft Execution**
- Write using "uncle mode" (action, momentum)
- Don't edit—just flow forward
- Stop mid-sentence when hitting good rhythm
- Produce minimum 2,000 words

**Hour 12-24: Rhythm Refinement**
- Read aloud—mark stumble points
- Apply color wheel—insert contrasting registers
- Cut 20% without losing meaning
- Ensure first and last paragraphs work together

**Output**: One complete piece (2,000+ words) using theme-first architecture

## 7-Day Sprint

| Day | Focus | Output |
|-----|-------|--------|
| 1 | Theme + Ending | Finalize theme, write ending, create tether |
| 2 | Character Architecture | Transformation mapping, opening scene |
| 3 | First Draft | Complete draft in uncle mode |
| 4 | Rhythm Pass | Read aloud, color wheel analysis |
| 5 | Tight Cut | Remove 25-30%, slow parts fast |
| 6 | Gravedigger Check | Verify angle, adjust if needed |
| 7 | Final Polish | Last read-aloud, ship |

**Output**: One polished piece ready for deployment
