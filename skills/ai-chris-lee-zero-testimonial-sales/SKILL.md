# AI Chris Lee — Zero Testimonial Sales Mastery

> Close high-ticket AI service clients without testimonials, case studies, or a portfolio.

## Overview

This skill captures AI Chris Lee's complete proof-building and sales system that enables service providers to land clients from day one. It solves the "proof paradox"—the false belief that you need clients to get clients.

**Expert**: AI Chris Lee — AI Services Sales Strategist | Zero→5 paying clients in 21 days | Execution Sprint Creator
**Domain**: AI Services Sales + Client Acquisition + Proof Building Systems
**Core Philosophy**: Proof can be manufactured without a single paying client. Outcome-focused proof makes testimonials irrelevant.

## Workflow Decision Tree

```
What's your situation?
│
├─ "I can't get clients without proof"
│   └─ Use: proof-paradox-escape → (select proof type)
│
├─ "I have a result but don't know how to show it"
│   └─ Use: proof-loom-builder (Outcome Proof)
│
├─ "I have NO results at all"
│   └─ Use: audit-proof-creator (Audit Proof)
│
├─ "My outreach isn't working"
│   └─ Use: proof-first-outreach + feature-to-outcome-converter
│
└─ "My messaging sounds too technical"
    └─ Use: feature-to-outcome-converter
```

## Quick Start

**The 3-Question Proof Test**:
Every proof asset must answer:
1. Who was this for?
2. What problem did you fix?
3. What outcome happened?

**Two Proof Types**:
- **Outcome Proof**: You have any result (paid OR unpaid). Document it.
- **Audit Proof**: Zero results but understand the niche. Publicly audit a business.

**Permission-Asking Tax**: Every "mind if I share..." adds friction. Replace with: "[Here's the proof]. Is this relevant to [their situation]?"
