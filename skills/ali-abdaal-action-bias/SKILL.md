# Ali Abdaal: Action Bias

> The complete system for breaking overthinking paralysis and building action momentum. Practical frameworks for overthinkers who know what to do but can't seem to do it.

## Overview

This extraction captures the Fresh x Ali Abdaal methodology for understanding why smart people get stuck and how to build systems that bias toward action. It's not about working harder—it's about removing the psychological friction that keeps overthinkers trapped in analysis.

**Core Principle**: Overthinking is a symptom, not the disease. The cure is structured experimentation, not more planning.

## Key Frameworks

**Two-Way Door Decisions**: Most decisions are reversible—treat them that way

**Overthinking Tax**: Every day of analysis has a cost; calculate it

**Experiment Cycle**: Hypothesis → Minimum test → Learn → Iterate

**Certainty Threshold**: 70% confident = enough to act
