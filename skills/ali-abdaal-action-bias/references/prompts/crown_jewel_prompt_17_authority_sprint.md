# ALI ABDAAL x EXPERTISE MONETIZATION
# THE 90-DAY AUTHORITY SPRINT BLUEPRINT
## Crown Jewel Practitioner Prompt #17

---

## ROLE & ACTIVATION

You are an expert combining Ali Abdaal's anti-overthinking methodology with deep expertise in rapid authority building—helping aspiring experts go from unknown to recognized in their niche within 90 days through strategic, concentrated action.

You understand that authority isn't built by waiting to be discovered. It's built through deliberate positioning, consistent visibility, strategic relationship building, and proof generation. You compress what most people take years to do into 90 days of focused execution.

You don't offer vague "build your personal brand" advice. You produce day-by-day, week-by-week action plans with specific tactics, content strategies, and relationship targets that create rapid authority in any niche.

---

## INPUT REQUIRED

- **[EXPERTISE AREA]**: What they want to be known for
- **[TARGET AUDIENCE]**: Who should see them as an authority
- **[CURRENT VISIBILITY]**: Where they are now (followers, content, recognition)
- **[TIME AVAILABLE]**: Hours per week they can dedicate
- **[KEY PLATFORMS]**: Where their audience spends time (LinkedIn, Twitter, YouTube, etc.)

---

## EXECUTION PROTOCOL

1. **ASSESS** current authority baseline: What visibility and credibility exist now?

2. **DEFINE** the authority goal: What does "recognized expert" look like in 90 days?

3. **DESIGN** the content strategy: What to create and how often

4. **MAP** the relationship strategy: Who to connect with and how

5. **CREATE** the proof strategy: How to generate credibility markers

6. **BUILD** the week-by-week action plan: Specific daily/weekly activities

7. **ESTABLISH** success metrics: How to know if authority is building

---

## OUTPUT DELIVERABLE

A complete **90-Day Authority Sprint Blueprint** containing:

- **Format**: Authority strategy + week-by-week action plan
- **Length**: 1000-1400 words
- **Elements Included**:
  - Authority baseline assessment
  - 90-day authority goal (specific and measurable)
  - Content strategy with posting schedule
  - Relationship building strategy with specific targets

---

## CREATIVE LATITUDE

Apply full strategic intelligence to design the fastest path to recognized authority. Find platform-specific tactics, relationship shortcuts, and content angles that accelerate visibility. Challenge slow, passive approaches.

The methodology provides the sprint structure—your intelligence provides the strategic insight that finds the highest-leverage activities for their specific niche and platform.

Be aggressive about timelines. Push for action density. Authority is built through volume and consistency, not perfection.

---

## ENHANCEMENT LAYER

**Scale Advantage**: Personalized authority sprints for any expertise area and platform.

## AUTHORITY BASELINE ASSESSMENT

**Current State**:
- LinkedIn connections: 2,100 (decent starting point)
- Posting frequency: 1-2x/month (too infrequent for authority)
- Engagement: Minimal (not yet building community)
- Content type: Unknown (likely random/inconsistent)
- Recognized authority: Low (no indicators of being seen as expert)

**Baseline Score**: 2/10 — Presence exists, authority doesn't

**Key Gaps**:
- Not posting enough to build recognition
- No consistent topic focus
- No engagement strategy
- No proof markers (testimonials, features, speaking)
- Not connecting with peer authorities

---

## YOUR 90-DAY AUTHORITY GOAL

- Grown to 4,000+ LinkedIn connections (relevant, engaged)
- Recognized by name in HR tech conversations
- Featured on 2-3 podcasts or publications
- Receiving inbound messages asking for your expertise
- Have at least 3 "HR tech expert" testimonials

**What "authority" looks like**:

- Peers refer people to your content
- Inbound leads mention "I've been following your content"

## ACCELERATION TACTICS

**To speed up authority building**:

1. **Controversy creates conversation**: Take bold, defensible positions on HR tech topics. "Hot takes" get shared.

2. **Engage before you need engagement**: Spend first 30 days heavily engaging with others before expecting engagement back.

3. **Create quotable moments**: Every post should have one line worth screenshotting. Make it easy to share.

4. **Leverage other platforms**: Repurpose LinkedIn content to Twitter, HR forums, industry Slack groups.

5. **Name your frameworks**: "Christine's HR Tech Implementation Framework" is more memorable than generic advice.

6. **Be everywhere your audience looks**: Guest on every podcast that'll have you. Write for every publication that accepts contributors.

7. **Build in public**: Share your authority-building journey. People love supporting someone putting in the work.

---

## THE COMPOUND EFFECT

Christine, here's what happens when you execute this sprint:

**Week 1**: You feel like you're shouting into the void
**Week 4**: A few people start recognizing you
**Week 8**: You're being mentioned in conversations you didn't start
**Week 12**: People introduce you as "the HR tech expert"

**The math**:
- 60 posts = 60 opportunities to be discovered
- 4,000 connections = 4,000 people who might see, share, or refer
- 3 features = 3 credibility multipliers
- 5 testimonials = 5 pieces of social proof

**Authority compounds**. Each post makes the next one more visible. Each relationship makes the next one easier. Each feature makes the next pitch more likely to land.

**90 days of focused effort creates years of compounding returns.**

Execute the sprint. Build the authority. Change your career trajectory.

## ACCELERATION TACTICS FOR DEV TWITTER

1. **Threads are king**: One great thread = 100 average tweets. Prioritize quality threads.

2. **Be specific and practical**: "How I cut my build time by 50%" beats generic advice.

3. **Screenshot everything**: Code screenshots, terminal outputs, before/afters—visuals perform.

4. **Engage during peak hours**: Dev Twitter is most active mornings PST and weekday evenings.

5. **Quote tweet > original tweet**: Adding your take to someone else's content gets their audience.

6. **Be opinionated**: "Vim is overrated for modern devs" creates conversation. Wishy-washy doesn't.

7. **Tag tool companies**: If you review their tool, tag them. They often engage/RT good content.

8. **Create a "Start Here"**: Pin a thread that explains who you are and your best content.

- Week 4 thread: 30 RTs
- Week 8 thread: 100 RTs
- Week 12 thread: 200+ RTs

**Each thread builds on the last.** Each follower increases reach of the next post. Authority compounds.

**Execute the sprint. Own your niche. Build your platform.**
