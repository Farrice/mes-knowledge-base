# Andrew Wilkinson AI Entrepreneurship

> With Claude Code, I feel like I have 30 new employees for $40/day. I can build things that would have taken months in hours.

## Overview

Andrew Wilkinson, founder of Tiny (holding company), demonstrates how to use Claude Code/Opus at the highest level—building real products like a $30K Relationship OS, automating entire life systems, and executing at speeds that create massive leverage. His approach: personal life automation first, then productize what works.

**Core Philosophy**: Build solutions for YOUR problems first. If they're valuable to you, they're valuable to others.

## Core Systems

| System | Purpose |
|--------|---------|
| **Personal Automation** | Relationship OS, wardrobe styling, email triage |
| **Vibe Coding** | Natural language → working products in hours |
| **Psychological Safety** | Manipulation detection, meeting analysis |
| **Investment Thesis** | Software moat analysis in AI era |

## Deployable Capabilities

| Prompt | Use When |
|--------|----------|
| [Personal Automation Architect](references/prompts/personal-automation-architect.md) | Building life automation systems |
| [Vibe Coding Executor](references/prompts/vibe-coding-executor.md) | Rapid product development |
| [Email Triage Builder](references/prompts/email-triage-builder.md) | Inbox transformation |
| [Meeting Intelligence](references/prompts/meeting-intelligence.md) | Automated meeting analysis |
| [Software Moat Analyzer](references/prompts/software-moat-analyzer.md) | Investment thesis evaluation |

## Key Principles

1. **Personal First**: Solve YOUR problems, then productize
2. **Speed of Thought**: ADHD + AI = productivity unlock
3. **30 Employees for $40/day**: Think of AI as staff, not tools
4. **Show Don't Tell**: Prototype first, explain later
5. **Pennies in Front of Steamroller**: Avoid obvious opportunities that get crushed

## The Wilkinson Stack

**Personal Automation**:
- Relationship OS (conflict prediction, therapy prep)
- Wardrobe System (zero-decision dressing)
- Email Triage (choose-your-own-adventure responses)
- School Notifications (kid schedule management)

**Business Intelligence**:
- Meeting Analysis (psychological safety nets)
- Investment Thesis (moat evaluation)
- Brand Management (voice consistency)

## Quick Start

1. **Identify personal friction** (what annoys you daily?)
2. **Rapid prototype** with Claude Code (24-48 hours)
3. **Use for yourself** (is it actually valuable?)
4. **Calculate value** (what would you pay for this?)
5. **Consider productization** (would others pay?)
