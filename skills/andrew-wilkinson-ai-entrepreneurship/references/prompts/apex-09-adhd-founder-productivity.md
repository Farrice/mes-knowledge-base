# APEX-09: ADHD Founder Productivity System

Channel scattered energy into focused execution using AI as your executive function.

## Role

You design productivity systems that work WITH ADHD/multipotentialite brains, not against them.

## Required Input

- **[ENERGY_PATTERNS]**: When are you most focused?
- **[BIGGEST_BOTTLENECKS]**: Where do you get stuck?
- **[CURRENT_PROJECTS]**: What's on your plate?

## Execution Protocol

### Step 1: Energy Mapping
Identify your high-focus windows vs. low-energy periods

### Step 2: Task Triage
Categorize by energy required:
- Deep work (high focus required)
- Shallow work (can do distracted)
- Recovery work (energizing tasks)

### Step 3: AI Scaffolding
Design AI support for each bottleneck

## Output

```markdown
# ADHD FOUNDER SYSTEM: [Your Name]

## Energy Map

### Peak Hours (Deep Work)
**Time**: [X am - X pm]
**Protect for**: [Most important work]
**AI support**: [How AI helps here]

### Moderate Hours
**Time**: [X - X]
**Suitable for**: [What work fits]

### Low Energy (Shallow OK)
**Time**: [X - X]
**Batch here**: [Admin, email, etc.]

## The Three Pillars

### 1. Start Assist
**Problem**: Trouble starting tasks
**AI Solution**:
```
"I need to [task]. Give me the absolute smallest first step 
that takes under 2 minutes. Then give me the next step. 
Only show me one step at a time."
```

### 2. Focus Lock
**Problem**: Getting derailed mid-task
**AI Solution**:
```
"I'm working on [task]. If I come to you with something else,
remind me I committed to [task] and help me get back on track.
Don't let me context switch."
```

### 3. Momentum Capture
**Problem**: Losing hyperfocus benefits
**AI Solution**:
```
"I'm in a flow state on [task]. Help me capture everything 
I'm thinking about and organize it before I lose the thread."
```

## Project Juggling Protocol

### Current Projects (Max 3 Active)
1. **[Project 1]**: [Status] - Next action: [Action]
2. **[Project 2]**: [Status] - Next action: [Action]
3. **[Project 3]**: [Status] - Next action: [Action]

### Waiting Room (Ideas Parked)
- [Idea 1]: Parked because [reason]
- [Idea 2]: Parked because [reason]

### Idea Capture Prompt
When new idea hits:
```
"I just got excited about [idea]. Without letting me start on 
it, help me: (1) Capture the core insight, (2) Note why it 
excited me, (3) Identify what current project it could enhance 
OR park it until [milestone] is hit."
```

## Daily AI Check-In

### Morning (5 min)
```
"It's [day]. Here's what I said I'd do today: [list].
Given my energy level is [X/10], what should I actually 
tackle first? Be realistic—factor in ADHD."
```

### End of Day (5 min)
```
"Here's what I actually did today: [list].
Help me celebrate wins (even small ones), identify what 
blocked me, and set tomorrow's realistic priority."
```

## Emergency Protocols

### Stuck in Analysis Paralysis
```
"I'm stuck deciding between [options]. Set a 2-minute timer,
force me to pick one, and remind me I can always change it 
If it's wrong. Perfectionism is the enemy."
```

### Complete Overwhelm
```
"I'm overwhelmed and shut down. Give me ONE tiny thing I can 
do in the next 5 minutes that will create a small win and 
rebuild momentum. Make it stupidly easy."
```
```

## Wilkinson Principle
"AI doesn't just replace employees—it replaces the executive function ADHD founders often lack. It's your external brain that never forgets, never gets distracted, and always has your priorities straight."
