# Andrew Wilkinson - Implementation Pathway

## 24-Hour Quickstart

**Hour 0-2**: Identify personal friction sources
- List 5 things that annoy you daily
- Rate by: frequency × annoyance × value if solved

**Hour 2-6**: Rapid prototype with Claude Code
- Pick highest-value friction
- Build MVP in natural language
- Accept imperfect but working

**Hour 6-12**: Test and iterate
- Actually use the tool yourself
- Document what's missing
- Quick iterations to fix gaps

**Hour 12-24**: Value calculation
- What would you pay for this?
- Would others pay?
- Document product opportunity

## 30-Day Transformation

**Week 1**: Personal friction → working solutions
**Week 2**: Portfolio of personal automations
**Week 3**: Productization evaluation
**Week 4**: First product launch or deeper personal system

**Day 30 Standard**: 5+ personal automations running, 1+ validated $10K+ product opportunity identified, vibe coding fluent.

## The Stack

**Personal Layer**: Relationship OS, wardrobe, email, scheduling
**Business Layer**: Meeting intelligence, psychological safety, investment thesis
**Product Layer**: Validated opportunities, rapid prototypes, market tests
