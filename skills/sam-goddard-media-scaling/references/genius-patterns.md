# Sam Goddard — Genius Patterns

## 1. The Aperture Widening Play
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Identifies when a niche audience becomes a ceiling, then systematically broadens content aperture without losing core identity. Executed this when Dan went from "SaaS founders only" to "buy back your time."
- **Executable Behavior**: Find the universal thread in your niche expertise. Package it as a book/manifesto for 10x wider audience. Use the launch as the forcing function to rebuild content strategy.
- **Deployment Context**: When a personal brand has maximized its niche (50K-150K followers) and needs to scale without becoming generic.
- **Success Metric**: Audience 10x+ while engagement stays within 30% of pre-pivot levels.

## 2. Infrastructure-Before-Attention Sequence
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Builds media team and operational infrastructure BEFORE going all-in on content production.
- **Executable Behavior**: Design team structure at 2x current output targets. Hire and train before you need them. Pay well. Then flood the zone.
- **Deployment Context**: Any creator/founder ready to move from "doing it all" to professional media operation.
- **Success Metric**: Content velocity doubles within 60 days without quality drops.

## 3. GoPro System (Go Professional)
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Treats content creation as a professional sport with phases, levels, and progressive investment. Never skips phases.
- **Executable Behavior**: Phase 1 (prove fit) → Phase 2 (add specialists) → Phase 3 (full operation) → Phase 4 (multi-6-figure media spend). Each phase must prove ROI before advancing.
- **Deployment Context**: Any creator deciding how much to invest in content operation.
- **Success Metric**: Each phase generates enough revenue/attention to fund the next.

## 4. Retention Engineering Over Views
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Prioritizes "reframes" and retention mechanisms over click-bait hooks. Keeps people watching, not just clicking.
- **Executable Behavior**: Every script must contain minimum 3 reframe moments — cognitive shifts planted strategically. These are "aha moments," not hooks.
- **Deployment Context**: Scripting any long-form content.
- **Success Metric**: Average view duration exceeds 50% of video length.

## 5. Attention Arbitrage Model
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Treats organic content as paid media equivalent. Calculates CPM-equivalents to prove organic beats paid.
- **Executable Behavior**: Calculate (monthly media cost ÷ monthly impressions × 1000). If below paid CPMs ($5-15), scale aggressively.
- **Deployment Context**: ROI evaluation of organic vs. paid content investment.
- **Success Metric**: Organic CPM-equivalent stays below $2-3 vs paid $5-15+.

## 6. The Decade Frame
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Operates with 10-25-50 year planning horizon. Changes every tactical decision.
- **Executable Behavior**: Before any major decision, ask "Does this compound over 10 years?" Build partnerships on "work together forever" assumption.
- **Deployment Context**: Strategic brand decisions, partnership evaluation, content pivots.
- **Success Metric**: Every major initiative has a 10+ year compounding thesis in one sentence.

## 7. Attention-to-Venture Pipeline
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Designs monetization as venture/incubator model rather than courses or coaching.
- **Executable Behavior**: Ask "what businesses can I invest in or incubate that benefit from this audience's trust?" Attention becomes equity, not transactions.
- **Deployment Context**: Creators with 1M+ audience who've outgrown course/coaching.
- **Success Metric**: Revenue per audience member exceeds $5/year through equity plays vs $0.50-$2 from info products.

## 8. Scriptwriter Quality Filter
- **What He Does Unconsciously**: Evaluates writers by one criterion: can they produce reframes that make the EXPERT pause?
- **Executable Behavior**: Test writers: "Take this concept, produce 5 reframes." If reframes feel like things you already know, they're not good enough. If they make you pause — hire.
- **Deployment Context**: Hiring writers, evaluating scripts, QA'ing content.
- **Success Metric**: At least 1 in 3 reframes makes the expert reconsider.
