# Sam Goddard — Media Scaling & Attention Monetization

The operating system behind scaling a founder's personal brand from niche expert to media empire. Sam Goddard built Dan Martell from 100K niche SaaS followers to 9M+ across platforms with 200M+ monthly views — then architected the monetization layer that turned that attention into Martell Ventures and an AI Incubator.

## Core Domain

Content operations at scale, phased media team building, retention-first scripting, attention-to-revenue architecture, audience aperture widening, decade-frame strategic planning.

## What Makes This Skill Different

Most personal brand skills focus on **content creation** (what to post, how to write hooks). This skill operates at the **systems layer** — how to build the team, scale the operation, engineer retention, and monetize attention at venture-scale. It's the difference between being a content creator and running a media company.

## Deployable Capabilities
