# 🚀 Seena Rez Launch Monitor

> **Goal**: Replicate the exact process of identifying an "Early Adopter" supply-demand gap from YouTube vlogs.
> **Skill**: `skills/seena_rez_early_adopter`

## Phase 1: Market Selection (The "Growing" Check)
1. **User Input**: Niche (e.g., "Pilates", "Pickleball", "Home Coffee Brewing").
2. **Validation**:
   - Check Google Trends (Must be upward trending 12mo).
   - Check CAGR reports (Is the market growing YoY?).

## Phase 2: The "Day in the Life" Extraction
**Agent Action**:
1. Search YouTube for: `"[Niche] day in the life"`, `"[Niche] morning routine"`, `"[Niche] vlog"`.
2. Select top 3 videos from *micro-influencers* (10k-100k subs) - NOT mega celebs.
3. Extract Transcripts.
4. **Analyze** (LLM Call):
   - Prompt: "Identify products mentioned that are being used daily but called by generic names (e.g., 'grippy socks' not 'BrandX'). Look for pain points like 'I wish I had' or 'I finally found'."

## Phase 3: Identity & Aesthetics Match
**Agent Action**:
1. Identify the "Avatar" from the videos (e.g., "Clean Girl Aesthetic", "Biohacker Dad").
2. Identify 3 "Love Brands" outside the niche (e.g., "They wear Alo, drink Erewhon, use Dyson").
3. **Visual Strategy**: Define the "Visual API" to copy (Lighting, Colors, Fonts).

## Phase 4: Product Source & Viral Hook
**Agent Action**:
1. Generate the **Manufacturing Spec**: Defines the "Premium" version of the generic product (Materials, Branding placement).
2. Script the **Viral Video** using the 3-Second Rule:
   - 0:00-0:03: Context/Hook.
   - 0:03: Beat Drop + Product Reveal.

## Output
Generate a **Launch Dossier**:
- **The Gap**: "Generic Product" opportunity found.
- **The Evidence**: Verbatim quotes from vloggers.
- **The Avatar**: Identity profile.
- **The Visual Strategy**: Which non-competitor to mirror.
- **The Viral Script**: Second-by-second breakdown.
