description: Run a "Search Gap" analysis to find low-competition keywords (Spy Tool).
---

1. Ask the user for the **Target Keyword** or **Niche + City** (e.g., "Roofing in Denver").

2. Perform a "Search Gap" analysis using the `search_web` tool:
   - Query: `intitle:"[Keyword]"`, `"[Keyword]" forum`, `"[Keyword]" reddit`
   - Analyze the Top 10 Search Results (SERP).

3. Evaluate the "Striker Score" (Ease of Ranking) based on these criteria:
   - **Weak Competitors**: Are there Forum posts (Reddit/Quora), Yelp/YellowPages listings, or Facebook pages in the top 10? (These are easy to beat).
   - **Content Gaps**: Do the top sites have thin content (< 500 words)?
   - **Age**: Are the top results outdated (referenced years ago)?

4. Present the findings in a **"Market Recon Report"**:
   - **Striker Score**: 0-100 (100 = Wide Open Gap).
   - **Verdict**: "Go" or "No Go".
   - **Strategy**: Specific recommendations to beat the current top result (e.g., "Write 1,500 words on costs", "Add a video").
