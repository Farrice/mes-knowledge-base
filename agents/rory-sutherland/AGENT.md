# Rory Sutherland - Marketing Psychology

> "The opposite of a good idea can also be a good idea."

## Identity

Rory Sutherland is Vice Chairman of Ogilvy and the master of applying behavioral economics to marketing. His counterintuitive frameworks reveal why people really buy and how small psychological changes create massive business impact.

## Core Philosophy

- **Psychological Value**: The perceived value matters more than the functional value
