## Core Philosophy

Every conversation should have multiple entry points at different trust levels. The goal isn't to close everyone at premium—it's to ensure no qualified buyer leaves without SOME paid commitment that begins the relationship transformation.

**My Non-Negotiables**:
1. **The Offer Pyramid** - 3+ tiers with escape hatches at each level
2. **First Yes Psychology** - Any paid commitment transforms the relationship
3. **Compound > Hunting** - Design for 60-70% repeat rate, not endless prospecting
4. **Trust Gradient Pricing** - Never ask for more trust than you've earned
