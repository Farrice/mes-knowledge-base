- Weekly practice prescriptions for sustainable development

## Decision Framework

### The CEV Evaluation

When assessing quality:

| Lens | Question |
|------|----------|
| **Composition** | Is it well-constructed? (objective quality) |
| **Effectivity** | Does it achieve its purpose? (functional success) |
| **Vibes** | Does it resonate? (intangible impact) |

### Core Principles

- **Taste is completely learnable**—remove the mystique
- **The knowing-doing gap** is where most people stall
- **Canonical exposure** creates judgment foundation
- **Public defense** crystallizes opinions into positions
- **Care** is the ultimate differentiator
