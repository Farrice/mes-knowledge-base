# MyBPM Event Planning Analysis
## First Event Feasibility & Strategy — Updated With Brand Context

---

## WHO MYBPM ALREADY IS

**MyBPM** (mybpm.store / @my.bpm) is an EDM streetwear brand founded by Farrice and Jennifer. It's not starting from zero — it has an identity, a story, and existing assets.

### Current Brand State
- **Instagram**: @my.bpm — 1,745 followers, 638 posts
- **Website**: mybpm.store (Shopify)
- **Positioning**: "Premium EDM Merch & Streetwear" — streetwear for ravers who live for the music, the culture, and PLUR
- **Collections**: Signature, Big Fish Little Fish Collab, What's Your BPM, PLUR, Exclusives, Radiant Love
- **Price range**: $25-$75
- **Production**: Unisex, hand-printed in USA, DTG on premium cotton
- **Press**: Featured on [EDM Maniac](https://edmmaniac.com/mybpm-streetwear/) — "This Rave Couple Started Their Own EDM Clothing Line"
- **Pinterest**: @mybpmstore
- **Tagline**: "We Make Clothing for Ravers Who Live for the Music, the Culture, and PLUR"
- **Origin story**: You and Jennifer met while checking out the same DJ, talked all night about EDM and festivals, long distance for a year, you moved to LA, been together since. The brand is built on that love story.

### The Honest Assessment of Where the Brand Is
- **638 posts with 1,745 followers** = the content hasn't been converting to growth. That's roughly 2.7 followers per post, which is low. Either the content strategy needs rework, the posting has been inconsistent, or both.
- **The brand hasn't been touched in a while** (your words) = the Instagram is likely dormant or near-dormant, which means the algorithm has deprioritized it.
- **The store exists and products are live** = this is actually a huge advantage for events (merch table revenue, brand visibility, something physical people take home).
- **The PLUR positioning is clear** = but it's also the same positioning as every rave brand. To stand out, MyBPM needs to evolve from "PLUR streetwear" into something more specific.

## THE DEAL ON THE TABLE

From Chris's venue find:
- **Location**: Hollywood, Las Palmas corridor
- **Capacity**: Up to 300
- **Amenities**: Bar, security, sound system included, 2 floors
- **Vibe**: "Looks like a mini Exchange"
- **Minimum spend**: Saturday $4K / Thursday $2.5K
- **Deal structure**: You keep the door charge; they keep bar sales. If bar sales hit the minimum spend, you owe nothing extra. If bar sales fall short, you cover the difference.
- **Parking**: Lot right across the street
- **Context**: They charged $12-17 cover last night with ~150 people
- **DJ connection**: MONIC — progressive house, opened for Audien recently
- **Merch**: They allow merch sales at the venue

## CORRECTED ASSET MAP

### What You Actually Have

**Your DJ Friends (4-6 people)**
- These are NOT producers with original tracks or dedicated fanbases
- They ARE skilled, experienced DJs who can spin incredible sets and create amazing vibes at parties
- They have experience doing events and parties — they know how to read a room
- They will NOT draw their own crowds. They are your product (the experience), not your marketing channel.
- This is actually fine — you don't need famous DJs to throw a great party. You need DJs who can make people not want to leave the dance floor.

**Your Influencer/Creator Friends (multiple people with 100k+ followers)**
- THIS is your real marketing weapon. This changes the entire calculus.
- A single influencer with 100k followers posting a story about your event reaches more people than a mid-tier DJ's entire fanbase
- Even at a conservative 2-3% conversion rate on a story post, one influencer with 100K followers = 2,000-3,000 people seeing your event with social proof
- 3-4 influencer friends posting = 8,000-12,000 impressions with built-in trust
- The question is: what's their audience demographic? Are their followers in LA? Are they 21+? Are they the "go out on a Thursday night" type?

**MONIC (via Chris)**
- Progressive house DJ who opened for Audien
- This is your credibility anchor — not because she draws huge crowds, but because "opened for Audien" is a real co-sign you can put on the flyer
- The name gives the event legitimacy beyond "my friends are DJing"

**MyBPM Brand + Store**
- You have an existing brand identity, logo, aesthetic, and product line
- You have a merch table ready to go — this is a revenue stream most first-time promoters don't have
- The brand gives the event a name that isn't just "a party" — it's a MyBPM event
- 1,745 Instagram followers is small but it's not zero — that's a base to reactivate

**Chris & Kim**
- Connected to the rave scene, have venue relationships
- Chris found the deal and clearly knows the landscape
- Kim knows the logistics (parking, setup, etc.)

### What's Working Against You
1. **The DJ friends don't draw** = you can't rely on talent to fill the room. The vibe will be great IF people show up. Getting them there is a separate problem.
2. **The brand has been dormant** = the Instagram algorithm has likely buried @my.bpm. Reactivation takes time.
3. **Jennifer's bandwidth** = two escrows, packing up her mom, inspections. She can't be the operator on this right now.
4. **Your time constraint** = 1-3 hours/day. The strategy and brand work is within your lane. The ground-level promo hustle is not.
5. **First-time promoter** = no track record with venues means worse deal terms and no room for negotiation leverage.

## THE INFLUENCER ANGLE CHANGES EVERYTHING

This is the single biggest update from the first analysis. Most first-time promoters have zero marketing reach. You have access to people who can put your event in front of tens of thousands of eyeballs for free.

### How to Deploy Your Influencer Friends

**The Ask (keep it simple and reciprocal):**
- "We're throwing our first MyBPM event in Hollywood. Would you post about it? We'll give you and your crew guest list + VIP treatment."
- This is not a paid promotion. This is friends showing up for friends. The authenticity makes it more effective, not less.

**The Timing:**
- Influencer post #1: 2 weeks before the event (awareness)
- Influencer post #2: 3-5 days before (urgency, "limited tickets left")
- Influencer post #3: Night-of stories (FOMO for event #2)

**The Content They Should Post:**
- NOT a generic "come to this party" flyer repost
- YES: "My friends are throwing their first event and I'm so excited" — personal, authentic, genuine
- Behind-the-scenes content: venue walkthrough, DJ practice sessions, merch unboxing
- The goal is to make their followers feel like they're getting access to something exclusive, not being marketed to

**The Math:**
- 3 influencer friends with 100K+ followers each
- Average story view rate: 5-10% = 5,000-10,000 story views per person
- 3 influencers = 15,000-30,000 story views
- Even at a 1% conversion to "interested" = 150-300 people who look up the event
- Even at 0.3% actual attendance conversion = 45-90 people just from influencer reach
- Add to that: your personal network (50-80), Chris & Kim's network (30-50), DJ friends' circles (20-40)
- **Realistic total reach: 150-250 people is genuinely achievable for your first event**

### Why This Is Your Unfair Advantage
Most first-time promoters spend $500-2,000 on ads that reach cold audiences. You have warm, trust-based reach through friends who happen to have audiences. This is not a small thing — this is the difference between 80 people and 200 people at your first event.

## REVISED PROFIT & LOSS SCENARIOS (With Influencer Reach)

### Scenario 1: Thursday Night With Influencer Support (RECOMMENDED)

| Item | Cost/Revenue |
|------|-------------|
| **Minimum spend guarantee** | -$2,500 |
| **DJ talent (your friends, 4 sets)** | -$400 to -$600 |
| **Photographer/videographer** | -$300 |
| **Miscellaneous (wristbands, supplies)** | -$200 |
| **TOTAL COSTS** | **-$3,400 to -$3,600** |

Revenue if 180 people show up at $15 door (realistic with influencer support):

| Revenue Source | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| **Door revenue (180 x $15)** | +$2,700 |
| **Merch sales (10% of attendees buy a $35 tee)** | +$630 (18 x $35) |
| **Bar sales** (180 x $22 avg = $3,960, covers the $2,500 minimum) | $0 owed |
| **TOTAL REVENUE** | **+$3,330** |
| **NET** | **-$70 to -$270 — essentially breakeven** |

Revenue if 220 people show up at $15/$20 split (optimistic but possible):

| Revenue Source | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| **Door revenue (100 presale x $15 + 120 door x $20)** | +$3,900 |
| **Merch sales (10% x $35)** | +$770 (22 x $35) |
| **Bar sales** (easily covers $2,500 minimum) | $0 owed |
| **TOTAL REVENUE** | **+$4,670** |
| **NET** | **+$1,070 to +$1,270 profit** |

### Scenario 2: Saturday Night With Full Influencer Push

| Item | Cost/Revenue |
|------|-------------|
| **Minimum spend guarantee** | -$4,000 |
| **DJ talent** | -$500 to -$800 |
| **Photographer/videographer** | -$300 |
| **Miscellaneous** | -$200 |
| **TOTAL COSTS** | **-$5,000 to -$5,300** |

Revenue if 250 people (room is buzzing):

| Revenue Source | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| **Door revenue (100 presale x $15 + 150 door x $20)** | +$4,500 |
| **Merch sales** | +$875 (25 x $35) |
| **Bar sales** (250 x $22 = $5,500, covers $4K minimum easily) | $0 owed |
| **TOTAL REVENUE** | **+$5,375** |
| **NET** | **+$75 to +$375 profit** |

Revenue if 300 (sold out):

| Revenue Source | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| **Door revenue (120 presale x $15 + 180 door x $25)** | +$6,300 |
| **Merch sales** | +$1,050 (30 x $35) |
| **Bar sales** (covers minimum, you don't see extra) | $0 owed |
| **TOTAL REVENUE** | **+$7,350** |
| **NET** | **+$2,050 to +$2,350 profit** |

### The Merch Multiplier Most Promoters Don't Have

Most first-time promoters have zero merch. You already have a product line. At events:
- 8-15% of attendees buy merch if the brand is visible and the designs are good
- Average item: $35
- 200 people x 10% x $35 = $700 in merch revenue
- This is pure margin (minus COGS, probably $8-12/shirt with DTG)
- Set up a merch table near the entrance/exit. Have someone friendly running it. Accept card payments (Square reader).
- This also builds the brand — people wearing MyBPM tees become walking billboards

---

## REVISED STRATEGY: LEVERAGING WHAT YOU ACTUALLY HAVE

### The Big Reframe

The original analysis assumed you were a cold-start promoter with no reach. You're not. You have:
- An existing brand with a store, products, and a story
- Influencer friends who can put your event in front of 100K+ people
- DJ friends who can deliver the experience (just not the crowd)
- A co-promotion team (Chris, Kim) with scene knowledge

**The strategy shifts from "build an audience from scratch" to "activate the network you already have."**

### Phase 1: Reactivate MyBPM (Weeks 1-3)

**1. Wake up the Instagram**
- Don't start posting product photos. Start with the story.
- Post #1: "We started MyBPM because we fell in love at a show. Now we're bringing the vibe to Hollywood." — your origin story, raw and real
- Post #2: Tease the event concept — "Something's coming" energy
- Post #3-5: Spotlight your DJ friends — short clips of them mixing, behind-the-scenes energy
- Reels: 15-30 second clips of DJ sets, venue energy, rave culture moments
- Go from dormant to 5x/week posting immediately
- Re-engage your 1,745 existing followers — many of them are probably friends, scene people, real connections

**2. Evolve the brand positioning for events**
- MyBPM the clothing brand = "streetwear for ravers"
- MyBPM the event brand = "the party where the culture comes alive"
- The two reinforce each other. The event IS the brand experience. The merch IS the takeaway.
- Think of it like how brands like The Hundreds or Supreme started — culture first, product second. MyBPM events become the cultural anchor, and the streetwear is how people represent that culture in daily life.

**3. Talk to your influencer friends NOW**
- Don't wait until the event is booked. Gauge interest early.
- "Hey, Jen and I are thinking about throwing a MyBPM event in Hollywood. Would you be down to pull up and post about it?"
- You need to know: How many would actually show up? How many would actually post? This determines your marketing firepower.

### Phase 2: Plan & Build (Weeks 3-6)

**4. Negotiate the venue deal**
- With influencer reach in your back pocket, you have more leverage than a random first-timer
- Chris's pitch to the venue: "We have influencer friends with combined reach of 300K+ who will be posting about this. We'll pack this room."
- Still recommend starting Thursday ($2,500 minimum) to prove the concept
- Ask about merch table setup — where, do they take a cut, any restrictions?

**5. Lock the lineup**
- 4-5 DJ sets across the night (45-60 min each)
- Open with your most energetic DJ to set the tone as people arrive
- Build through the night with genre flow: deep house opener → progressive house → melodic techno peak → high-energy closer
- MONIC gets a prime slot (10:30-11:30 PM range) as the credibility anchor

**6. Create the event identity**
- The event needs a name beyond just "MyBPM presents." Give it a series name.
- Ideas that align with the brand: "BPM Sessions," "Pulse," "The Drop," "Heart Rate"
- The series name lets you build a recurring brand within the brand
- Design a flyer that matches your streetwear aesthetic — not generic EDM neon, but your brand's look

**7. Ticket strategy**
- Use DICE or Eventbrite (DICE is more credible in the electronic music scene)
- Tier 1: "Inner Circle" $10 (first 50 tickets — your core network)
- Tier 2: Advance $15
- Tier 3: Door $20
- Influencer friends get guest list + a promo code they can share ("use code [INFLUENCER NAME] for $12 tickets") — this also lets you track which influencer drives the most sales

**8. The influencer campaign**
- Create a shared Google Drive or Dropbox with: event flyer, venue photos, DJ photos, 2-3 caption options
- Make it effortless for them to post. The less work they have to do, the more likely they'll do it.
- Stagger the posts: Week 2 before event = awareness, Week 1 = urgency, Night-of = FOMO content
- If any influencer friends are willing to do a "get ready with me for MyBPM" reel or story series, that's gold

### Phase 3: Execute (Weeks 6-8)

**9. Week-of operations**
- Confirm all DJ set times and equipment needs
- Confirm merch inventory (bring your best sellers, have sizes ready)
- Brief your influencer friends: "Post a story when you arrive, tag @my.bpm"
- Set up a branded photo moment at the venue (MyBPM backdrop, good lighting) — this generates organic content
- Assign clear roles:
  - **You**: Brand, content capture, overall experience oversight
  - **Chris**: Venue liaison, security coordination, bar relationship
  - **Kim**: Door management, guest list, ticket reconciliation
  - **Jennifer**: Merch table (if bandwidth allows) or assign a trusted friend
  - **Designated content person**: Photographer/videographer capturing the night

**10. Night-of revenue maximization**
- Merch table near entrance — people see it coming in AND going out
- Have a Square/card reader. Nobody carries cash.
- If the venue allows, offer a "ticket + tee" bundle at the door for $30 (vs. $20 door + $35 tee separate = $55). This feels like a deal and moves more merch.
- Capture emails at the merch table: "Drop your email for early access to the next event + 20% off your next MyBPM order"

### Phase 4: Compound (Week 9+)

**11. Post-event content blitz**
- Post highlights within 24 hours (while people are still buzzing)
- Tag every influencer who came. Tag every DJ. Tag the venue.
- Repost every story/post from attendees — this is social proof for event #2
- Send a recap email to everyone who bought tickets or gave you their email
- Post DJ set recordings (if captured) to SoundCloud/Mixcloud under the MyBPM brand

**12. Leverage the event for the store**
- "Were you at BPM Sessions Vol. 1? Rep the vibe" — drive event attendees to the store
- Consider a limited edition "Vol. 1" tee or design — scarcity creates urgency
- The event content becomes store marketing content. A photo of someone dancing in a MyBPM tee is worth more than any product photo on a white background.

## GENRE POSITIONING

### What's Trending in 2025-2026 That Fits Your DJ Network

| Genre | Trend Status | Why It Works for MyBPM |
|-------|-------------|----------------------|
| **Progressive House** | Revival — growing momentum, Audien-era nostalgia | MONIC plays this. Emotional, accessible, crowd-friendly. Not polarizing. |
| **Melodic Techno** | Strong and steady — emotional depth | Pairs perfectly with progressive house. Appeals to broader demo beyond hardcore ravers. |
| **Afro Tech / Afro House** | Exploding — 700% growth in production | Only if your DJs spin it. Hot genre but needs authentic representation. |
| **House (deep/tech)** | LA's bread and butter | Safe foundation. Every DJ in LA can play this. Less differentiated. |
| **Drum & Bass** | Surging — 3rd on Beatport | Growing fast but very specific crowd. Could work as a "special night" genre rotation. |

**Recommendation**: Lead with **progressive house + melodic techno** as MyBPM's sound identity. It's:
- Trending upward (progressive house revival is real)
- Matched to MONIC and likely your other DJ friends
- Emotionally resonant — people feel something, which matches PLUR
- Accessible to non-hardcore electronic music fans (your influencer friends' audiences)
- Differentiated from the hard techno saturation in LA right now

### The Vibe to Create

Think less "rave" and more "elevated house party that happens to be in a Hollywood venue." The MyBPM brand is streetwear, not kandi bracelets. The event should match:
- Clean, intentional aesthetic (not chaotic festival energy)
- Music you can actually talk over early in the night, that builds to peak energy
- Fashion-forward crowd (your influencer friends set this tone just by being there)
- PLUR values without the cliché — inclusive, welcoming, no pretension, but elevated

---

## LEAD TIME BREAKDOWN (REVISED)

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestones |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Reactivate Brand | 3 weeks | Instagram alive, influencer commitments confirmed, event concept defined |
| Plan & Build | 3 weeks | Venue locked, lineup set, tickets on sale, influencer content calendar ready |
| Promote & Execute | 2 weeks | Ticket sales tracked, final push, night-of operations |
| **Total minimum lead time** | **8 weeks** | From "go" to doors open |

**Realistic target**: If you start now (early February 2026), target **early-to-mid April 2026** for the first event. That gives you a full 8-10 weeks and avoids Jennifer's current escrow crunch.

---

## WHAT FIRST-TIMERS GET WRONG (AND HOW TO AVOID IT)

### 1. Booking a room too big for your crowd
A packed 150-person room beats a half-empty 300-person room every time. With the 300-cap venue, you need 200+ to feel alive. The two-floor layout could help — keep the second floor "VIP" or closed early, then open it when the room fills. This creates the perception of growth through the night.

### 2. Not paying DJs (even friends)
Pay your friends $100-200 per set. Non-negotiable. "We're all doing this together" is beautiful until someone feels exploited. Budget $400-600 for 4 DJs. It's the cost of keeping relationships intact.

### 3. Relying on DJs to draw the crowd
This is YOUR biggest trap. Your DJs create the vibe, they don't create the attendance. The crowd comes from: (a) influencer reach, (b) personal network, (c) Chris and Kim's rave network. The DJs make them stay and come back. Different functions.

### 4. Not having a demand signal before committing money
Put tickets on sale 3-4 weeks early. If you don't sell 30% of your target in the first week, recalibrate before spending more. Advance ticket sales are your fire alarm — they tell you if the building is hot or not.

### 5. Wasting the influencer opportunity
Don't just say "post about our event." Give them content assets (flyer, venue pics, captions), make it frictionless, and coordinate timing. One influencer posting the day before is 10x more effective than four influencers posting three weeks early and then going silent.

### 6. Not capturing content
Hire a photographer/videographer for $200-400. Content from event #1 is what sells event #2, sells merch, and proves the brand is real. This is not optional.

### 7. Ignoring the bar sales math
If 120 people come and average $20 at the bar ($2,400) on a Thursday ($2,500 minimum), you owe the venue $100 out of pocket. Model every scenario. Know your break-even attendance number before you sign anything.

### 8. Treating the event as separate from the brand
The event IS the brand activation. The merch IS the takeaway. The content IS the marketing. Everything should feed everything else. Don't throw a party that has nothing to do with MyBPM's identity.

---

## THE MERCH STRATEGY (YOUR SECRET WEAPON)

Most first-time promoters have zero product to sell. You have an entire store. This is a significant advantage.

### At the Event
- **Merch table**: Near entrance/exit. Branded display. Card reader ready.
- **Best sellers only**: Bring your 3-4 most popular items in key sizes. Don't overcomplicate.
- **Bundle deal**: "Ticket + tee" for $30 at the door (vs. $20 door + $35 tee separate). People love perceived value.
- **Email capture**: "Drop your email for 20% off your next MyBPM order + early access to Vol. 2"

### Post-Event
- **Limited edition**: Design a "BPM Sessions Vol. 1" tee or sticker. Only available to people who were there or who order within 48 hours. Scarcity creates urgency and makes event #1 feel like a moment.
- **Event content as product marketing**: Photos of people wearing MyBPM at the event > product photos on white backgrounds. Use event content in store marketing and social.
- **Cross-sell loop**: Event attendees → store customers → event #2 attendees. Every touchpoint should drive the next one.

### Revenue Projection
- 200 attendees, 10-15% merch conversion = 20-30 sales
- Average item price $35, COGS ~$10 = $25 profit per item
- **Merch profit: $500-$750 per event** — this compounds as the brand grows

---

## RISK-REWARD REALITY (REVISED)

### Best case (first event, Thursday):
- 220 people, $2,500 minimum
- Door revenue: $3,900 (100 presale x $15 + 120 door x $20)
- Merch profit: $600
- Bar covers minimum, no gap owed
- Costs: $3,500
- **Net: +$1,000 profit, content library built, email list started, proof of concept locked**

### Likely case:
- 160 people, Thursday, $2,500 minimum
- Door revenue: $2,550 (80 presale x $15 + 80 door x $20)
- Merch profit: $400
- Bar: 160 x $22 = $3,520, covers minimum
- Costs: $3,500
- **Net: -$550 loss — but you have a brand event, content, list, and momentum**

### Worst case:
- 80 people, Thursday, $2,500 minimum
- Door revenue: $1,200 (80 x $15)
- Merch profit: $200
- Bar: 80 x $20 = $1,600, gap owed = $900
- Costs: $3,700 (including gap)
- **Net: -$2,300 loss — painful but survivable, and you learned everything**

### The real framing:
With your influencer network, the "likely" and "best" scenarios are more realistic than they'd be for a typical first-timer. **Your expected loss on event #1 is $0-$500, not $1,300-$2,200.** The influencer reach genuinely changes the math.

---

## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER BEFORE YOU COMMIT

1. **How many influencer friends will actually commit to posting?** Get verbal yeses before you book the venue. 3+ committed influencers = green light. 1 or fewer = recalibrate.

2. **What are your influencer friends' audience demographics?** LA-based? Age 21+? Nightlife-adjacent? If their followers are mostly 16-year-olds in another state, the reach doesn't convert to attendance.

3. **Who is the day-to-day operator?** Chris seems ready. But someone needs to own the project plan week by week. Is that you (strategy + accountability) with Chris executing?

4. **What's the upfront cash you're willing to risk?** Budget $2,000-$3,000. Can you absorb that if things go sideways?

5. **What's the split between everyone involved?** Who puts up capital? Who does what work? How are profits (and losses) divided? This conversation happens BEFORE money is spent.

6. **Can Jennifer be involved at all, or is she fully tapped?** Even 2-3 hours a week on the merch side and her personal network would help. But if the escrows have her maxed, plan around that.

7. **What merch inventory do you have on hand?** You don't want to order new stock for event #1. Use what you've got. What's your current inventory look like?

---

## BOTTOM LINE

The previous analysis assumed you were starting from zero. You're not. **You have an existing brand, a product line, an origin story, a dormant-but-real Instagram audience, and — most importantly — influencer friends who can put your event in front of hundreds of thousands of eyeballs.**

Your DJ friends don't draw crowds, but they deliver the experience. Your influencer friends don't spin records, but they fill rooms. Together, that's a complete package.

The play:
1. **Reactivate @my.bpm NOW** — story-driven content, DJ spotlights, event tease
2. **Lock influencer commitments** — you need 3+ genuine yeses before booking the venue
3. **Start Thursday at $2,500 minimum** — prove the concept with lower risk
4. **Use your merch as a revenue stream AND brand builder** — you have this and nobody else does at their first event
5. **8-10 week runway** — target mid-April 2026
6. **Break even or small profit is genuinely realistic** for your first event given the influencer angle

This isn't "paying tuition" anymore. With the right execution, this is a legitimate brand activation that could profit from day one and set up a recurring event series. The key variable is whether your influencer friends actually show up and post. Confirm that, and the rest is execution.
