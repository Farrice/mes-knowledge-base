# MyBPM Event Planning Analysis
## First Event Feasibility & Strategy for an Unknown Brand

---

## THE DEAL ON THE TABLE

From Chris's venue find:
- **Location**: Hollywood, Las Palmas corridor
- **Capacity**: Up to 300
- **Amenities**: Bar, security, sound system included, 2 floors
- **Vibe**: "Looks like a mini Exchange"
- **Minimum spend**: Saturday $4K / Thursday $2.5K
- **Deal structure**: You keep the door charge; they keep bar sales. If bar sales hit the minimum spend, you owe nothing extra. If bar sales fall short, you cover the difference.
- **Parking**: Lot right across the street
- **Context**: They charged $12-17 cover last night with ~150 people
- **DJ connection**: MONIC — progressive house, opened for Audien recently

---

## HONEST ASSESSMENT: IS THIS REALISTIC?

**Short answer**: Yes, but not with this specific deal on your first event.

Here's why. The $4K Saturday minimum spend is a bet that 300 people will show up and drink. For an unknown brand's first event, that is aggressive. The realistic attendance for a first-time promoter with no existing audience or track record is **75-150 people**, not 300. If you get 100 people and they spend $25/person at the bar (which is optimistic), that's $2,500 in bar sales — meaning you'd owe the venue $1,500 out of pocket to cover the gap.

**The smarter first move**: Thursday night at $2.5K minimum spend, or negotiate a lower minimum for a weeknight. Thursday is also better strategically — less competition from established promoters who own Friday/Saturday slots, and the electronic music crowd in LA goes out on weekdays more than most cities.

## THE REAL NUMBERS: PROFIT & LOSS SCENARIOS

### Scenario 1: Thursday Night, Conservative (RECOMMENDED FIRST EVENT)

| Item | Cost/Revenue |
|------|-------------|
| **Minimum spend guarantee** | -$2,500 |
| **DJ talent (your friends)** | -$400 to -$800 (pay them something, even friends) |
| **Marketing/promotion** | -$300 to -$500 |
| **Miscellaneous (wristbands, supplies)** | -$200 |
| **TOTAL COSTS** | **-$3,400 to -$4,000** |

Revenue if 120 people show up at $15 door:

| Revenue Source | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| **Door revenue (120 x $15)** | +$1,800 |
| **Bar sales offset** (if 120 people avg $25/person = $3,000, you owe nothing extra — but you also don't earn from bar) | $0 |
| **NET** | **-$1,600 to -$2,200 loss** |

Revenue if 150 people show up at $15 door:

| Revenue Source | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| **Door revenue (150 x $15)** | +$2,250 |
| **Bar sales** (150 x $25 = $3,750, covers minimum + surplus you don't see) | $0 |
| **NET** | **-$1,150 to -$1,750 loss** |

Revenue if 200 people show up at $20 door:

| Revenue Source | Amount |
|----------------|--------|
| **Door revenue (200 x $20)** | +$4,000 |
| **Bar sales** (200 x $25 = $5,000, covers the $2,500 minimum easily) | $0 |
| **NET** | **Breakeven to +$600 profit** |

### Scenario 2: Saturday Night, Aggressive

| Item | Cost/Revenue |
|------|-------------|
| **Minimum spend guarantee** | -$4,000 |
| **DJ talent** | -$500 to -$1,000 |
| **Marketing** | -$500 |
| **Miscellaneous** | -$200 |
| **TOTAL COSTS** | **-$5,200 to -$5,700** |

You need 250+ people at $20-25 door AND enough bar sales to hit $4K to break even. That is not a first-event scenario.

### The Honest Math

To actually profit on a Saturday with this deal structure:
- 250 people x $20 door = $5,000 door revenue
- Bar sales need to hit $4K (250 x $16/person minimum)
- Subtract $5,700 costs = **-$700 loss to modest profit**

To profit meaningfully (worth your time and risk):
- 300 people x $25 door = $7,500
- Bar sales comfortably hit $4K
- Subtract $5,700 costs = **+$1,800 profit**
- Split 3 ways between you, Chris, and Kim = **$600 each**

That's why established promoters do this regularly — the margins compound with volume, reputation, and lower artist costs through relationships. But for a first event, you're essentially paying tuition.

## WHAT WOULD ACTUALLY MAKE THIS WORK

### Your Assets (What You're Working With)

1. **4-6 DJ friends** = you have a lineup without paying headliner rates
2. **2 DJs with actual audiences** = they bring their own crowds (this is your biggest asset)
3. **MONIC** (via Chris) = progressive house with Audien co-sign = credibility anchor
4. **MyBPM as a brand** = fresh, unknown but nameable — "BPM" is music-native language
5. **Chris & Kim** = they clearly know the scene and have venue relationships
6. **Your wife** = real estate hustle shows she can execute on operational complexity
7. **Your skill set** = systems thinking, brand strategy, marketing psychology

### Your Liabilities (What's Working Against You)

1. **No track record** = venues give worse deals to unproven promoters
2. **No email list or following** = can't sell advance tickets to gauge demand
3. **No content machine running** = MyBPM has no social presence to leverage
4. **Your wife's bandwidth** = she's in the middle of two escrows
5. **Your time constraint** = 1-3 hours/day means you can't be the one doing ground-level promo

---

## THE STRATEGY: HOW TO DO THIS RIGHT

### Phase 1: Foundation (Weeks 1-4) — BUILD BEFORE YOU BOOK

Do not book the venue yet. Use this time to:

**1. Define MyBPM's identity**
- What does MyBPM stand for? Is it a party brand? A DJ collective? A vibe?
- Pick a lane: Are you curating an experience (like Sound Nightclub's philosophy-driven approach) or throwing a party (like a classic rave promoter)?
- The strongest new brands in LA right now are community-driven collectives with a clear point of view. DEF (Define Everything Future), a female-owned collective, broke out in 2025 by having a sharp identity.

**2. Pick your genre positioning**
What's trending and what fits your DJ network:

| Genre | Trend Status | Fit for MyBPM? |
|-------|-------------|----------------|
| **Progressive House** | Revival happening — growing momentum | Yes — MONIC plays this, Audien association |
| **Afro Tech / Afro House** | Exploding — 700% growth in production | Only if your DJs play it |
| **Melodic Techno** | Strong and steady — emotional, accessible | Good entry point for broader audiences |
| **House (deep/tech)** | LA's bread and butter — always works | Safe bet, competitive space |
| **Hard Techno** | Peaked but still draws crowds | Niche audience, polarizing |
| **Drum & Bass** | Surging — 3rd on Beatport | Growing fast but specific crowd |

**Recommendation**: Position MyBPM around **progressive house + melodic techno** — it's accessible, emotional, trending upward, and matches your existing DJ network (MONIC). It also differentiates from the hard techno wave that's saturating LA right now.

**3. Start the content engine NOW**
- Create MyBPM Instagram. Post 3-5x/week.
- Content: DJ friend spotlights, behind-the-scenes studio sessions, genre education ("what is progressive house and why it's coming back"), venue scouting clips, playlist curation
- Start a MyBPM playlist on Spotify/Apple Music featuring your DJ friends' tracks
- Goal: 500-1,000 followers before your first event

**4. Build the list**
- Simple landing page: "MyBPM is coming. Get early access to our first event."
- Collect emails. Even 200 emails is gold for a first event.

### Phase 2: Pre-Production (Weeks 5-8) — PLAN THE EVENT

**5. Negotiate the right deal**
- Start with Thursday, not Saturday
- Ask Chris to negotiate: "First event, building the brand. Can we do $1,500-$2,000 minimum on a Thursday as a trial? If we deliver 150+ people and they drink, we'll book Saturdays."
- Venues want consistent promoters who fill rooms. They'll often cut deals on slower nights to develop new talent.

**6. Build the lineup strategically**
- **Headliner slot**: Your DJ friend with the biggest audience. This is who you market.
- **Support**: MONIC + 1-2 of your other DJ friends
- **Opener**: Your least-known DJ friend (early slot, builds their resume)
- Total talent cost should be $500-$1,000 if these are friends. Pay them. Even $100-200 per set shows respect and keeps relationships healthy.

**7. Price the door right**
- Tiered pricing: Early bird $10 (first 50 tickets) → Advance $15 → Door $20
- Use Eventbrite, DICE, or Resident Advisor for ticketing
- Early bird sales give you a demand signal. If you sell 50 early birds in week 1, you're on track. If you sell 10, recalibrate.

**8. Marketing plan**
- Your DJ friends promote to their audiences (this is your #1 channel)
- Instagram Reels: venue teasers, DJ snippets, "the vibe we're creating"
- Micro-influencer outreach: find 5-10 LA nightlife accounts with 1K-10K followers, offer guest list for posts
- Group chat mobilization: everyone in Chris and Kim's rave network gets personal invites
- Flyer drops at other events (if you go to shows, hand out cards)
- Cross-promote on 19hz.info (LA's definitive electronic music event listing)

### Phase 3: Execution (Weeks 8-10) — THE EVENT

**9. Week-of checklist**
- Confirm all DJ set times and equipment needs
- Confirm venue details (load-in time, sound check, bar setup)
- Final social media push (countdown content, "last chance" for advance tickets)
- Assign roles: Who's on door? Who's managing the DJs? Who's handling problems?
- Have a cash reserve of $1,000-$1,500 for unexpected issues

**10. Night-of operations**
- Someone sober and organized runs the door (count every person, track revenue)
- Someone manages the DJ transitions (no dead air, smooth handoffs)
- Someone handles the venue relationship (bar manager, security, any issues)
- Take content: photos, video clips, crowd shots. This is marketing for event #2.

### Phase 4: Post-Event (Week 11+) — COMPOUND

**11. The day after**
- Post highlights on Instagram (photos, video, crowd energy)
- Send email to your list: "Thank you. Here's what's next."
- Debrief with your team: What worked? What didn't? What do we do differently?
- Settle finances with the venue and your DJs

**12. Build toward event #2**
- If event #1 drew 120+ and the vibe was right, you have proof of concept
- Book the next one 4-6 weeks later. Momentum matters.
- Grow the list, grow the following, grow the reputation

## LEAD TIME BREAKDOWN

| Phase | Duration | Key Milestones |
|-------|----------|----------------|
| Foundation | 4 weeks | Brand identity, social media launched, content engine running |
| Pre-Production | 4 weeks | Venue booked, lineup locked, tickets on sale, marketing live |
| Final Push | 2 weeks | Ticket sales ramp, final promo, operations planning |
| **Total minimum lead time** | **8-10 weeks** | From "go" to doors open |

If your wife is currently buried in escrow and inspections, and you're working 1-3 hours/day, a realistic timeline is:
- **Start building MyBPM's presence now** (you can do this in your time window)
- **Target a Thursday night event in late April or May 2026**
- That gives you 10-12 weeks of runway

## WHAT FIRST-TIMERS GET WRONG (AND HOW TO AVOID IT)

### 1. Booking a room too big for your crowd
**The fix**: A packed 150-person room beats a half-empty 300-person room every time. The energy of a full room IS the product. If the venue is 300 capacity, you need to feel confident about 200+ showing up, or it'll feel dead.

### 2. Not paying DJs (even friends)
**The fix**: Pay your friends $100-200 per set minimum. "Exposure" is not payment. The fastest way to burn DJ relationships is to exploit them. Budget for it.

### 3. Spending money on the wrong marketing
**The fix**: Don't buy Instagram ads or Facebook ads for your first event. Your first event's audience comes from: (a) your DJ friends' followers, (b) personal invitations through group chats and DMs, (c) word-of-mouth from 5-10 people who are genuinely excited. Paid ads work for event #5, not event #1.

### 4. Not having a demand signal before committing money
**The fix**: Put tickets on sale 3-4 weeks before the event. If you don't sell 30% of your target within the first week, something is wrong — either the marketing isn't working, the price is wrong, or the demand isn't there. You need this information BEFORE you've spent money on production.

### 5. Trying to do everything yourself
**The fix**: You need at minimum 3 people with clear roles:
- **Promoter/Marketing** (this is you — strategy, content, brand)
- **Operations/Venue** (this is Chris — he has the venue relationship)
- **Talent/Music** (whoever in your crew knows the DJ scene best)

### 6. Not capturing content
**The fix**: Hire a photographer/videographer for $200-400. The content from event #1 is what sells event #2. If you have no photos or video, you have no proof it happened.

### 7. Ignoring the bar sales math
**The fix**: In the deal Chris described, the venue's minimum spend is essentially your risk floor. If 100 people come and spend $20 each at the bar ($2,000), and the minimum is $2,500, YOU owe $500. Model this out before you commit. The bar revenue isn't "free money" — it's the venue's insurance policy, and you're the guarantor.

### 8. No plan for event #2
**The fix**: Before event #1 happens, know when event #2 will be. Collect emails at the door. Announce "next month" from the stage. The first event is an investment; the second event is where you start to see returns.

## THE RISK-REWARD REALITY

### Best case (first event):
- 200 people, Thursday night, $2,500 minimum
- Door revenue: $3,000 (200 x $15)
- Costs: $3,500 (venue covered by bar sales + $1,000 talent/marketing)
- **Net: -$500 loss, but you have a brand, content, a list, and proof of concept**

### Likely case (first event):
- 120 people, Thursday night, $2,500 minimum
- Door revenue: $1,800 (120 x $15)
- Bar sales: $2,400 (120 x $20), you owe $100 gap to venue
- Costs: $3,100 total
- **Net: -$1,300 loss, which is your brand-building investment**

### Worst case (first event):
- 60 people, Saturday night, $4,000 minimum
- Door revenue: $1,200 (60 x $20)
- Bar sales: $1,200 (60 x $20), you owe $2,800 gap to venue
- Costs: $5,500 total
- **Net: -$4,300 loss and a discouraging start**

### The honest framing:
Your first event is not a money-making venture. It's a **$1,000-$2,000 investment** in building a brand, testing a concept, and learning the business. If you go in expecting profit, you'll be disappointed. If you go in expecting to learn and build, you'll be in the right headspace.

Profit starts at event #3-5, when you have a following, a reputation, a content library, and venue leverage.

## WHAT MYBPM COULD BECOME

If you're thinking about this as a real brand and not a one-off party, here's the trajectory:

**Months 1-3**: Build social presence, throw first event (Thursday, small), learn the mechanics
**Months 4-6**: Second and third events, growing attendance, building email list to 500+
**Months 7-12**: Move to Saturdays, start booking mid-tier DJs with real followings, attendance 200-300
**Year 2**: MyBPM is a known brand in the LA progressive house scene, recurring monthly events, potential for merch revenue, sponsorship opportunities, and actual profit margins of $2,000-5,000/event

The brands that win in this space are the ones that show up consistently. One event means nothing. Monthly events for a year means everything.

---

## QUESTIONS TO ANSWER BEFORE YOU COMMIT

1. **Who is the "operator" on this?** Chris seems plugged in. Your wife has the hustle but is currently overloaded. You have the strategy brain but limited time. Who is the day-to-day driver?

2. **What's the upfront cash you're willing to risk?** Budget $2,000-$3,000 as your "tuition" for event #1. Can you absorb that loss if things go sideways?

3. **Is this a side hustle or a brand build?** If it's a one-off party with friends, the stakes are low and the math doesn't matter much. If it's building MyBPM into something real, you need the 10-week runway and the content strategy.

4. **Can your DJ friends actually draw?** "Having an audience" needs to be quantified. How many Instagram followers? How many people actually show up when they play? 500 Instagram followers ≠ 50 people at a show. Ask them directly: "If we throw an event, how many people can you personally bring?"

5. **What's the split between you, Chris, and Kim?** This conversation needs to happen before money is spent. Who puts up capital? Who does what work? How are profits (and losses) divided?

---

## BOTTOM LINE

This is doable. The venue deal is real, the genre timing is good (progressive house is in a revival), and you have DJ friends who can fill a lineup. But the difference between losing $4K and building something that actually works comes down to:

1. **Start Thursday, not Saturday** — lower risk, lower minimum, better for building
2. **10 weeks of runway minimum** — don't rush this
3. **Build the brand before the event** — social media, content, email list
4. **Budget $2,000-$3,000 as learning investment** — don't expect profit on event #1
5. **200 people in a 300-cap room** is a great first event. 100 people is a learning experience. 300 people is unrealistic for event #1.
6. **Have the money conversation with Chris and Kim now** — roles, investment, splits

The music scene in LA is thriving. Electronic music is a $12.9 billion global industry. Progressive house is having a moment. You have the strategy mind to build this into a real brand. But go in clear-eyed about the economics and the timeline.
