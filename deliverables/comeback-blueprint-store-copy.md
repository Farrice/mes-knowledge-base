## PROBLEM SECTION

**Headline**:
```
Physical Therapy Ended. But You're Still Stuck.
```

**Body Copy**:
```
You've been cleared for exercise. Doctors say you're "fine."

But you don't feel fine.

You stare at the gym from your car, afraid to go in. You pick up a weight and immediately set it down, terrified of that feeling again. You see people doing what you used to do—and wonder if that will ever be you.

Physical therapy got you walking. It didn't teach you how to LIVE again. How to train again. How to trust your body again.

The fitness industry has nothing for you. Every program assumes you're either a beginner or fully healthy. You're neither. You're someone who knows exactly what they've lost—and is terrified of losing it again.

That's why we created The Comeback Blueprint.

```
From Terrified to Training Again
```

**Testimonial 1**:

— Marcus T., Colorado
[ACL Reconstruction ✓]

## FAQ SECTION

**Section Headline**:
```
Questions? We've Got Answers.
```

**Q1**: *I'm still in physical therapy. Is it too early?*
```
This program is designed for people who have been cleared (or are close to being cleared) for independent exercise. If you're still in active PT, finish that first—then use this as your bridge to full training.
```

**Q2**: *Does this work for my specific injury?*
```
The core methodology (psychology, progressive exposure, building trust) works for ANY injury. We also include specific chapters for knee, back, shoulder, and hip injuries, plus post-surgery protocols.
```

**Q3**: *I'm not trying to become an athlete. Is this still for me?*
```
Absolutely. This isn't about becoming elite—it's about becoming confident in your body again. Whether your goal is playing with your kids or returning to competitive sports, the principles are the same.
```

**Q4**: *What if the exercises are too hard for me?*
```
We start at absolute zero. The first week is literally just mobility and movement patterns with no weight. You progress at YOUR pace. There's no ego here.
```

**Q5**: *Is this just for weight training?*
```
The principles apply to any physical activity—running, cycling, swimming, yoga, hiking. The methodology is about rebuilding trust and capacity in your body, whatever your preferred training style.
```

**Q6**: *What if it doesn't work for me?*
```
Full 60-day money-back guarantee. Go through the program. If you don't feel significantly more confident and capable, email us for a complete refund. No questions.

```
Your Body Is Ready. Is Your Mind?
```

**Body Copy**:
```
Doctors cleared you months ago. Your body has healed.

But you haven't. Not really.

Every day you stay stuck is another day of watching other people do what you used to do. Another day of wondering if you'll ever feel like yourself again. Another day of fear winning.

That fear is valid. Your body learned something painful. But fear without a plan keeps you stuck forever.

The Comeback Blueprint IS your plan.

175+ pages of exactly how to rebuild—safely, sanely, systematically. Written by someone who rebuilt from the same place you are right now.

You've already survived the injury. You've already done the hard part.

Now it's time to come back.
