## Content Creation Stages

### Stage 1: Concept (Who + What)

**Expert:** Dai Media (Consumer Posture)
```
@dai-media Who is the ONE individual this content is for?
What's their Consumer Posture? What can't they say that I need to articulate?
```

**Expert:** Caleb Ralston (Personal Brand)
```
@caleb-ralston Does this content align with my contrarian position?
Does it build my credibility bank?
```

**Output:**
- Individual consumer profile
- Why this content for this person now
- Brand alignment confirmation

---

### Stage 2: Structure (How)

**For Storytelling Content:**
```
@shaan-puri What's the Intention + Obstacle structure?
Where's the 5-second transformation moment?
What emotion am I transferring?
```

**For Educational Content:**
```
@mitch-albom What's the theme?
What does this content want the reader to feel?
```

**For Conversion Content:**
```
@cardinal-mason Which of the 7 principles applies?
What's the transformation I'm selling?
```

**Output:**
- Content structure/outline
- Emotional target
- Key transformation point

---

### Stage 3: Hooks (Entry Point)

**Expert:** Shaan Puri or Seena Rez
```
@shaan-puri Give me 5 hook variations for this content.
Apply the frame-before-hook principle.
```

```
@seena-rez Make this hook hyperdopamine.
What's the PSAEP structure for the opening?
```

**Output:**
- 5 hook options ranked by strength
- Opening that stops scrolling

---

### Stage 4: Draft (First Pass)

Write the draft using the structure from Stage 2.

**Mindset from Mitch Albom:**
- Theme first, always
- Slow parts fast, fast parts slow
- Stop mid-sentence when flowing (to return eager)

**Mindset from Dan Wang:**
- Texture over tectonic plates
- Concrete details that ground abstractions
- Musical sentence variation

---

### Stage 5: Evaluation (Quality Check)

**Expert:** Harry Dry (Three Rules Test)
```
@harry-dry Evaluate this content:
1. Can I visualize it? (Concrete vs abstract)
2. Can I falsify it? (Specific vs vague)
3. Is it unique to me? (Differentiated vs generic)
```

**Expert:** Cardinal Mason (Conversion Check)
```
@cardinal-mason Does this content:
- Lead with transformation?
- Create emotional urgency?
- Have clear next action?
```

**Output:**
- Specific edits needed
- Weak points identified
- Strength confirmation

---

### Stage 6: Polish (Final Pass)

Apply final improvements:

**From Harry Dry:**
- Zoom-In Technique: Replace abstractions with specifics
- Falsifiability Filter: Replace adjectives with facts
- One-Mississippi Test: Two-second comprehension

**From Mitch Albom:**
- Tight cut: Remove anything that doesn't earn its place
- First/last paragraph marriage: Do they work together?

**From Erica Mallet:**
- Tone word filter: Does it match your 3 tone words?
- Enemy effect: Does it create tribal belonging?

---

### Stage 7: Publish

Before publishing, final check:
- [ ] Consumer posture validated (Dai Media)
- [ ] Structure sound (Shaan Puri / Mitch Albom)
- [ ] Hook stops scrolling (Shaan Puri / Seena Rez)
- [ ] Three Rules Test passed (Harry Dry)
