# Directive: Invoke Expert

> How to call on a specific expert from your council

---

## Purpose

Invoke a single expert agent to get their unique perspective, frameworks, and approach applied to your current challenge.

---

## When to Use

- You need a specific expert's methodology applied
- The challenge clearly falls within one expert's domain
- You want depth over breadth
- You're executing a known framework

## Invocation Methods

### Method 1: @mention
```
@jeremy-miner Help me handle this sales objection
@mitch-albom What's the theme of this story?
@dai-media Build a consumer posture for this brand
```

### Method 2: Natural Language
```
"What would Jeremy Miner say about this?"
"I need Shaan Puri's perspective on this content"
"Help me using Harry Dry's approach"
```

### Method 3: Domain Keywords
The system will auto-route based on keywords:
- Sales/objection/persuasion → Jeremy Miner
- Identity/mindset/transformation → Michael Bernoff
- Copywriting/conversion → Cardinal Mason or Harry Dry
- Storytelling/content/hooks → Shaan Puri
- Personal brand/differentiation → Caleb Ralston

## Process

### Step 1: Identify the Expert

Give the expert enough context to work with:

- Relevant background
- Constraints or requirements
- What success looks like

### Step 4: Engage with Frameworks
The expert will apply their specific frameworks. Engage with follow-up questions to go deeper.

### Step 5: Capture Output

## Example Session

**You:** @jeremy-miner I have a prospect who said "I need to think about it" after my pitch. How do I handle this?

**Jeremy Miner (via agent):** *Applies NEPQ framework*
- This objection usually means you haven't created enough emotional urgency
- Let me ask: Did you establish their identity around the problem first?
- Try this reframe: "When you say you need to think about it, help me understand—what specifically are you uncertain about?"
- The goal is to surface the real objection behind the smoke screen...
