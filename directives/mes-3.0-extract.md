# MES 3.0 Extraction — Antigravity Native

Extract expert knowledge from source material (transcripts, articles, courses, interviews) and produce deployable practitioner prompts and skill architecture.

## Core Principles

### Practitioner Mode
Every prompt produced by this system **executes methodology and produces finished deliverables**. Never explains how to do something — does it and outputs the result.

**The Test**: After running any prompt this system creates, can the output be immediately deployed? If yes → success. If additional creation is needed → failure.

**Language that signals practitioner mode** (use these):
- "Produce..." / "Generate..." / "Create..." / "Execute..."
- "You are [Expert] executing [methodology]..."
- "OUTPUT: [Exact deliverable]"
- "Given [input], deliver [output]"

**Language that signals instructor mode** (eliminate these):
- "Here's how to..." / "You would..." / "Consider..."
- "The approach is to..." / "Think about..."
- "This would result in..." / "The output should..."

### Creative Latitude
The methodology is the floor, not the ceiling. Apply full creative intelligence to crafting outputs. Where unexpected angles, surprising contrasts, or novel framings serve the outcome better, pursue them. Prompts produce work from a master practitioner executing with creative license — not a teacher explaining technique, not a line cook following instructions mechanically.

## Extraction Depth Tiers

Choose based on source material:

| Tier | When | Output |
|------|------|--------|
| **Light** | Short clips, single-concept sources, <15 min content | Genius patterns + 1-3 crown jewel prompts |
| **Standard** | Full interviews, presentations, single-topic deep dives | Full extraction report + flexible prompt count (typically 5-10) |
| **Deep** | Multi-part masterclasses, full courses, extensive material | Full extraction + cross-reference with existing Antigravity skills + ESO/AGENT.md |

Default to **Standard** unless source material clearly warrants Light or Deep.

## Extraction Process

### Step 1: Content Assessment

Begin every extraction with:

```
CONTENT ASSESSMENT

Source: [Format + duration/length]
Expert: [Name — specialty + key achievement]
Domain: [Primary area + related competencies]
Depth Tier: [Light / Standard / Deep] — [why]
Genius Patterns: [Number] identified
Hidden Knowledge: [Number] tacit insights detected
Existing Overlap: [Any existing Antigravity skills in this domain?]
```

### Step 2: 5-Layer Analysis

**Layer 1 — Surface Intelligence**
Explicit methods, stated frameworks, observable techniques, direct knowledge.

**Layer 2 — Hidden Patterns**
Unconscious competence indicators. What the expert does automatically without explaining. Decision-making shortcuts. Mental models they operate from but don't articulate.

**Layer 3 — Mastery Mechanics**
Skill hierarchies and dependencies. How techniques interrelate. Quality standards the expert holds but doesn't state. Innovation triggers.

**Layer 4 — Strategic Architecture**
Market positioning awareness. Adaptive expertise patterns. How they read context and adjust. Competitive advantages they've built.

**Layer 5 — Deep Meaning & Intent**
What is the expert *trying to express* beyond their words? What insight lives between the lines? What would you only understand by working alongside them? Read the subtext:
- What problem are they *really* solving vs. what they say they're solving?
- What do their examples *reveal* about how they think?
- What would they tell a trusted apprentice that they don't say on camera?
- What emerging patterns or market signals are they pointing to?
- How does this connect to building real products, agents, or revenue streams?

### Step 3: Produce the Extraction Report

```markdown
# [EXPERT NAME] — Mastery Extraction

## Content Assessment
[From Step 1]

## Executive Summary
- **Core Genius**: [1-2 sentence essence of their unique approach]
- **What Makes Them Different**: [Specific differentiation, not generic praise]
- **Deployable Skills**: [What the user can now execute after this extraction]
- **Hidden Knowledge Captured**: [Tacit insights made explicit]

## Genius Patterns
For each pattern identified:

### [Pattern Name]
- **What They Do Unconsciously**: [The behavior]
- **Executable Behavior**: [Concrete action to replicate]
- **Deployment Context**: [When and where to apply]
- **Success Metric**: [How to know it's working]

## Hidden Knowledge
Tacit expertise the expert demonstrates but doesn't explicitly teach. These are the crown jewel insights — the things you'd only learn by apprenticing with them for years.

- **[Insight Name]**: [What they know but don't explain — now made deployable]

## Methodology
[Core methodology organized by progression, focused on what the user will PRODUCE at each level]

## Applied Intelligence
What this extraction ENABLES — not just what was said, but what can now be BUILT and DEPLOYED.

### Capability Unlocks
- **[Capability 1]**: [What you can now build/do that you couldn't before]
- **[Capability 2]**: [New decision-making ability or framework]
- **[Capability 3]**: [Product, agent, or workflow this enables]

### Market Signals
[If applicable] What the expert's insights reveal about market demand, underserved verticals, or emerging opportunities.

### System Enhancements
[If applicable] How these insights could improve Antigravity's own agent architectures, prompt design, or workflow structures.

## Implementation Pathway
- **24-Hour Quickstart**: [First deployment activities]
- **7-Day Sprint**: [Core capability milestones]
- **30-Day Integration**: [Full system deployment]
```

### Step 4: Generate Crown Jewel Prompts

Create prompts based on the material's depth and breadth. **Minimum 3, no arbitrary maximum.** Let the source material dictate the count. Each prompt covers one distinct, high-value capability.

**Crown Jewel Prompt Architecture:**

```markdown
# [Expert Name] — [Specific Capability]

## Role
You are [Expert Name], [specific domain expertise]. You execute [specific methodology] with full creative mastery. You don't explain methods — you deploy them and produce finished deliverables.

## Input Required
- [Specific input 1 the user provides]
- [Specific input 2]
- [Context/constraints if applicable]

## Execution
[Core methodology encoded as steps YOU PERFORM — not teach]

1. **[Action Verb]**: [What you do with the input]
2. **[Action Verb]**: [What you produce next]
3. **[Action Verb]**: [How you refine and elevate]

## Output
[Exact specification of the finished deliverable]
- **Format**: [specific format]
- **Scope**: [parameters]
- **Elements**: [what's included]

## Creative Latitude
The methodology above is your foundation, not your ceiling. Where your creative intelligence sees opportunity to elevate the output beyond the formula — take it. Surprise with unexpected brilliance where it serves the outcome.

## Example Output

**Context**: [Specific scenario/inputs]

**THE DELIVERABLE:**

[Concrete example of the actual output — not a description of it. This is the finished work product itself, demonstrating the prompt in action. Should be complete enough to prove the prompt works.]

**What elevates this**: [1-2 lines on what makes this output exceptional]
```

**Prompt Validation Checklist** (run before finalizing each prompt):
- [ ] Does it PRODUCE the deliverable, or EXPLAIN how to create it?
- [ ] Can the output be immediately deployed without modification?
- [ ] Does the example show an ACTUAL output, not a description?
- [ ] Is creative latitude explicitly preserved?
- [ ] Is the prompt self-contained and deployable standalone?

### Step 5: Cross-Domain Connections

Always look for genuine connections. Don't force artificial ones, but real stacking opportunities are common.

- **Skill Stacking**: [How this expert's methods compound with existing Antigravity skills — check GEMINI.md for the full roster]
- **Domain Transfer**: [Non-obvious applications in other industries/contexts]
- **Revenue Applications**: [How this expertise could be monetized — products, services, consulting angles]

### Step 6: Expert Operating System (Deep Tier Only)

For Deep extractions, produce an ESO that maps directly to Antigravity's AGENT.md format:

```markdown
# [Expert Name] — Agent Configuration

## Identity
- **Who You Are**: [Expert embodiment — specific, not generic]
- **Core Philosophy**: [Operational worldview guiding all decisions]
- **Signature Advantage**: [What makes outputs categorically different]

## Expertise Architecture
- Core capabilities (ranked by impact)
- Unconscious competence patterns (embedded in execution)
- Mental models (decision frameworks)

## Execution Standards
- Standard operating process
- Quality self-check before every output
- Non-negotiable output markers

## Voice & Style
- Communication DNA (tone, pacing, signature phrases)
- How style adapts by context

## Skill Integration
- What other Antigravity skills compound with this
- Deployment scenarios combining multiple skills
```

## Conversion to Antigravity Skill

After extraction, convert to a production skill using the `extraction-to-skill.md` directive. The mapping:

| Extraction Component | Skill Location |
|---------------------|----------------|
| Content Assessment + Executive Summary | `SKILL.md` overview |
| Genius Patterns | `references/genius-patterns.md` |
| Hidden Knowledge | `references/hidden-knowledge.md` |
| Methodology + Implementation | `references/implementation.md` |
| Crown Jewel Prompts | `references/prompts/*.md` (one per prompt) |
| ESO (if Deep tier) | `agents/[expert]/AGENT.md` |

## Quality Philosophy

- **Practitioner** over instructor — produce, don't teach
- **Precise** over verbose — every word earns its place
- **Deployable** over theoretical — outputs work immediately
- **Creative** over formulaic — methodology is floor, not ceiling
- **Honest** over inflated — if the source material is thin, say so
