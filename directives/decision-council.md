# Directive: Decision Council

> Major decision framework using your expert council

---

## Purpose

When facing significant decisions, convene your expert council to get multiple perspectives, stress-test options, and arrive at a decision with confidence.

---

## When to Use

- Major business decisions (pricing, positioning, pivots)
- High-stakes opportunities (partnerships, investments, launches)
- Career-defining choices
- Decisions with significant downside risk
- When you're torn between options

---

## Decision Council Process

### Step 1: Frame the Decision (5 minutes)

Define clearly:
```
DECISION: [What specifically needs to be decided]
OPTIONS:
  A. [Option A description]
  B. [Option B description]
  C. [Option C / Status quo]
STAKES: [What's at risk / What's possible]
TIMELINE: [When this needs to be decided]
REVERSIBILITY: [Can this be undone? At what cost?]
```

### Step 2: Select Council Members (2 minutes)

Choose 3-5 experts based on decision domain:

**Revenue/Business Decisions:**
- Jeremy Miner (sales psychology)
- Samuel Thompson (unit economics)
- Cardinal Mason (positioning)

**Brand/Positioning Decisions:**
- Dai Media (consumer psychology)
- Caleb Ralston (differentiation)
- Erica Mallet (brand magnetism)

**Content/Creative Decisions:**
- Shaan Puri (audience building)
- Mitch Albom (craft quality)
- Harry Dry (effectiveness)

**Strategic/Life Decisions:**
- Jim O'Shaughnessy (cross-domain synthesis)
- Michael Bernoff (identity alignment)
- Lulu Cheng Meservey (narrative/positioning)

**AI/Systems Decisions:**
- Nate B Jones (architecture)
- Futurepedia (optimization)
- Darrel Wilson (monetization)

### Step 3: Individual Consultations (15 minutes)

Present the framed decision to each expert. Capture:
- Their recommended option
- Key reasoning
- Risks they see
- What they'd need to know
- Their unique framework applied

### Step 4: Synthesis Meeting (10 minutes)

Bring perspectives together:

```
DECISION SYNTHESIS

Agreement:
- Experts who agree: [names]
- Their shared reasoning: [why]

Disagreement:
- Where experts differ: [the split]
- Root cause of difference: [why they see it differently]

Unique Insights:
- [Expert]: [insight only they provided]
- [Expert]: [insight only they provided]

Red Flags Raised:
- [Concern raised by expert]
- [Concern raised by expert]

Missing Information:
- [What we'd need to know to decide better]
```

### Step 5: Decision & Commitment (5 minutes)

Make the call:
```
DECISION: [What you're choosing]
REASONING: [Why, informed by council]
IMPLEMENTATION: [First 3 actions]
REVIEW POINT: [When you'll evaluate the decision]
REVERSAL TRIGGER: [What would make you reconsider]
```

## Example: Pricing Decision

**Decision:** Should I raise my course price from $497 to $997?

**Council Selected:** Jeremy Miner, Samuel Thompson, Caleb Ralston

**Jeremy Miner's Input:**
- Higher price = higher perceived value
- But only if your sales process creates identity transformation
- The question: Are you selling to the identity that pays $997?
- Recommendation: Raise price, but rebuild the sales narrative first

**Samuel Thompson's Input:**
- Run the unit economics both ways
- At $497 with 2% conversion: need 200 visitors per sale
- At $997 with 1.5% conversion: need 66 visitors per sale
- Higher price often has similar conversion with right positioning
- Recommendation: Raise price, add payment plan option

**Caleb Ralston's Input:**
- Price signals who you are in the market
- $497 = "accessible option" positioning
- $997 = "premium solution" positioning
- What's your credibility bank? Can you justify premium?
- Recommendation: Raise price only if you're adding perceived value signals

**Synthesis:**
- Agreement: All three support raising the price
- Condition: Sales narrative must shift to premium identity
- Risk: Without positioning work, conversion may drop >50%
- Action: Rebuild sales page with premium positioning FIRST, then raise price

**Decision:**
- Raise price to $997
- But first: 2 weeks of positioning work with Cardinal Mason
- Add payment plan as Samuel suggested
- Review conversion after 30 days
- Reversal trigger: If conversion drops below 0.8%, reconsider

## Quick Decision Framework

For smaller decisions, use this abbreviated process:

```
Decision: [What]
Ask @jim-oshaughnessy: "Pre-fall or post-fall assessment?"
Ask @michael-bernoff: "Is this aligned with my identity?"
Ask [domain expert]: "[Domain-specific question]"
Decide in 10 minutes. Move on.
```

## Decision Journal

Track major decisions and outcomes:

| Date | Decision | Council Used | Choice Made | Outcome (90 days) |
|------|----------|--------------|-------------|-------------------|
| | | | | |

Review quarterly to:
- Identify which experts gave best advice
- Spot patterns in your decision-making
- Learn from what worked/didn't
