# Directive: Sales Conversation Prep

> Prepare for sales conversations using Jeremy Miner + Michael Bernoff

---

## Purpose

Prepare for any sales conversation—discovery calls, pitches, objection handling, closing—using the combined frameworks of Jeremy Miner (NEPQ, Identity Selling) and Michael Bernoff (Identity Engineering, Reset Frame).

---

## When to Use

- Before discovery calls
- Before sales presentations
- Before pricing conversations
- When anticipating objections
- When following up with prospects
- Before negotiations

---

## Pre-Conversation Prep (15 minutes)

### Step 1: Identity Mapping

**Ask Michael Bernoff:**
```
@michael-bernoff Help me understand this prospect's identity.

Prospect: [Name/Description]
Their current situation: [What they're dealing with]
What they've tried: [Previous solutions]

What identity are they holding that's keeping them stuck?
What identity do they need to step into?
What's the Wrong Question they're asking themselves?
```

**Output:**
- Current identity limiting belief
- Target identity transformation
- Reset frame to use

---

### Step 2: Conversation Framework

**Ask Jeremy Miner:**
```
@jeremy-miner Help me structure this sales conversation.

Product/Service: [What I'm selling]
Prospect: [Who they are]
Their likely objections: [What I expect]
My goal: [Outcome I want]

What's my Pre-Frame Formula?
Which of the 4 Identity Types is this prospect?
How should I frame the conversation?
```

**Output:**
- Pre-frame to set up conversation
- Identity type identification
- Conversation structure

---

### Step 3: Objection Inoculation

**Ask Jeremy Miner:**
```
@jeremy-miner What objections should I expect and inoculate against?

Common objections for my offer:
1. [Objection 1]
2. [Objection 2]
3. [Objection 3]

How do I address these BEFORE they come up?
How do I reframe if they surface?
```

**Output:**
- Inoculation statements to use early
- Reframes for each objection

---

## Conversation Framework

### Opening (First 2 Minutes)

**Reset Frame (Bernoff):**
Take control in the first 9 words. Set the frame for the conversation.

Example: "Before we dive in, I want to understand exactly what success looks like for you—not what you think I want to hear, but what would actually change your situation."

**Pre-Frame (Miner):**
Elevate perceived value before presenting anything.

Example: "I'm not sure if this is right for you yet. Let me understand your situation first, and we'll both know by the end if this makes sense."

---

### Discovery (10-15 Minutes)

**NEPQ Questions (Miner):**
Neuro-Emotional Persuasion Questions that create emotional engagement.

1. **Situation Questions:** "What's happening now?"
2. **Problem Questions:** "What's that costing you?"
3. **Implication Questions:** "If nothing changes, what happens?"
4. **Need-Payoff Questions:** "If we solved this, what would that mean for you?"

**Identity Questions (Bernoff):**
- "Who do you need to become to solve this?"
- "What's been stopping you from getting this result before?"
- "If you had this solved, how would you describe yourself differently?"

---

### Presentation (5-10 Minutes)

**Identity Bridge (Combined):**
Bridge from their current identity to their transformed identity through your solution.

Structure:
1. "Based on what you've shared, you're someone who [current identity positive]..."
2. "What's been missing is [gap your solution fills]..."
3. "What this does is help you become [transformed identity]..."
4. "People like you who [transformed identity marker] typically [result]..."

---

### Objection Handling

**When they say "I need to think about it":**

Bernoff approach:
"I totally understand. Can I ask—when you say you need to think about it, is it the [money/timing/fit] you're uncertain about, or something else?"

Miner approach:
"That makes sense. Most people who end up loving this said the same thing. What specifically would you be thinking through?"

**When they say "It's too expensive":**

Bernoff approach:
"I hear you. Is it that the price is higher than you expected, or that you're not sure the value justifies the investment?"

Miner approach:
"I appreciate you saying that. Let me ask—compared to the cost of [their problem continuing], how does this investment look?"

**When they say "I need to talk to [spouse/partner/team]":**

Bernoff approach:
"Absolutely, that makes sense. If they were here right now, what do you think they'd want to know?"

Miner approach:
"Of course. Just so I understand—if they said yes, is this something you'd move forward with?"

---

### Closing

**Identity Close (Combined):**
"Based on everything we've discussed, you've told me you want [their goal] and you're ready to [transformation]. The only question is—are you the kind of person who takes action when they see the path, or do you need more time to think about becoming [transformed identity]?"

**Commitment Reframe (Bernoff):**
"This isn't about buying a product—it's about committing to the person you've told me you want to become."
