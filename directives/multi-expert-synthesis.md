# Directive: Multi-Expert Synthesis

> How to combine multiple expert perspectives for comprehensive analysis

---

## Purpose

Get multiple experts to weigh in on the same challenge, then synthesize their perspectives into a unified approach that's stronger than any single viewpoint.

---

## When to Use

- Complex challenges that span multiple domains
- You want to see different angles before deciding
- The challenge could be approached multiple ways
- You want to stress-test an idea against different frameworks

---

## Invocation Methods

### Method 1: Direct Multi-Expert Call
```
"What would @jeremy-miner and @michael-bernoff say about this sales challenge?"
"Get perspectives from @shaan-puri, @harry-dry, and @mitch-albom on this content"
```

### Method 2: Council Invocation
```
@revenue-council What's the best approach for this pricing decision?
@content-council Review this newsletter draft
@brand-council Help me position this new offer
```

### Method 3: Comparison Request
```
"Compare Jeremy Miner's approach with Michael Bernoff's for this objection"
"How would Cardinal Mason vs Harry Dry approach this landing page?"
```

---

## Process

### Step 1: Define the Challenge
Clearly articulate what you're trying to solve. The same challenge will be presented to all experts.

### Step 2: Select Experts
Choose 2-4 experts whose frameworks are relevant. Consider:
- Complementary perspectives (sales + identity)
- Different methodologies (copy evaluation + storytelling)
- Cross-domain synthesis (writing + brand + psychology)

### Step 3: Gather Individual Perspectives
Each expert applies their framework independently:
- Expert A's analysis using their frameworks
- Expert B's analysis using their frameworks
- Expert C's analysis using their frameworks

### Step 4: Identify Patterns
Look for:
- **Agreement points** - Where experts converge
- **Unique insights** - What only one expert catches
- **Tension points** - Where experts disagree
- **Blind spots** - What no expert addressed

### Step 5: Synthesize
Create a unified approach that:
- Incorporates agreement points as foundation
- Layers unique insights from each expert
- Resolves tensions with reasoned decisions
- Addresses blind spots with additional analysis

## Example Session

**Challenge:** "I need to create a sales page for my new course"

**Experts Invoked:** Cardinal Mason, Harry Dry, Jeremy Miner

**Cardinal Mason (Conversion Copy):**
- Use the 7 Copywriting Principles
- Structure: Problem → Agitation → Solution → Proof → Offer
- Focus on transformation, not features
- Include 3+ testimonials minimum

**Harry Dry (Copy Evaluation):**
- Apply Three Rules Test: Can you visualize it? Can you falsify it? Is it unique?
- Zoom-In Technique: Replace abstractions with specifics
- Every claim needs concrete proof
- Two-second comprehension test for headline

**Jeremy Miner (Sales Psychology):**
- Pre-frame the visitor's identity before the pitch
- Address the 4 identity types in your audience
- Anticipate and inoculate against objections
- Use identity-based language, not benefit-based

**Synthesis:**
1. **Foundation** (Agreement): All three emphasize transformation over features and the need for proof
2. **From Cardinal Mason**: Use Problem-Agitation-Solution structure with testimonials
3. **From Harry Dry**: Apply Three Rules Test to every claim, ensure two-second headline comprehension
4. **From Jeremy Miner**: Add identity pre-frame section before the main pitch, address objections proactively
5. **Combined approach**: Identity pre-frame → Problem/Agitation → Solution with zoom-in specifics → Social proof → Offer with objection handling
