## 📋 Quick Summary

| Item | Status |
|------|--------|
| **Client** | Josh Banday |
| **Objective** | Secure a 2026 TV Writing Fellowship (Disney, NBC, WB, Paramount) |
| **Core Strategy** | "De-Risked Talent" positioning — leveraging Series Regular status |
| **Key Breakthrough** | Greg Daniels warm connection — existing elite validation |
| **Next Action** | Complete Warm Reactivation Protocol + Fellowship applications |

---

## 1. The "De-Risked Talent" Thesis

> **Core Insight:** Most fellowship applicants are "Emerging Writers" (unknowns). Josh is not. He is an **Emerging Showrunner**.

### Why This Works (Judge Psychology)

Fellowship program directors are **risk-averse**. They select writers who will succeed in a room *immediately*.

- **The Fear:** Hiring a "great voice" who freezes in a room, can't take notes, or doesn't understand production
- **The Relief:** Josh Banday
  - ✅ **Proven** — Survived network schedules (*Upload*, *Not Dead Yet*)
  - ✅ **Safe** — Knows the politics of a set ("No A**holes" rule)
  - ✅ **Ready** — Dialogue is already "actor-proof" because an actor wrote it

### The Pivot
Josh is not asking for a chance to learn — he demonstrates he has **already learned** the hardest parts. The fellowship is just the certification.

---

## 2. Identity Architecture: "The Actor-Auteur"

### The Individual: "The Double Threat"
Josh is a working TV professional (*Upload*, *Not Dead Yet*) who has spent years delivering other people's lines with impeccable comic timing. Now he is reclaiming his voice.

**Intersectionality Engine:** Black/Filipino/Mexican/Jewish/LGBTQ+ — not just a bio stat, it's the engine of his performance and pen.

### Occupation: "The Set-Tested Pro"
Most fellowship applicants have never stepped on a soundstage. Josh lives there. He knows:
- The rhythm of a table read
- The pressure of a rewrite
- The mechanics of a joke (because he's performed them)

### Activity: "The Improv Pivot"
- Trained at **Second City** and **Groundlings**
- Writes with an improviser's brain — "Yes, And"-ing his own characters
- Dialogue travels from page to mouth effortlessly because he tests it on himself
- Currently writing **two pilots** and an **animated feature** while working as series regular

### Thought Process: "The Insider Logic"
> "I've played the 'Best Friend'; now I write the 'Main Character'."

His comedy comes from being the most interesting person in the scene but having the fewest lines. He writes to center the stories usually pushed to the B-plot.

### The Posture Synthesis
He isn't asking for a break. He is asking for **the chair**. He positions as the next Donald Glover or Issa Rae — talent who can write, act, and showrun because they understand the entire machine.

## 3. The Win Condition (Strategic Hooks)

| Hook Type | Positioning |
|-----------|-------------|
| **Strategic** | "The Series Regular who wants to run the show" |
| **Emotional** | "The Code-Switcher who found his true voice" |
| **Tactical** | "The De-Risked Hire who is ready for the room on Day 1" |

---

## 4. Fellowship Targeting Matrix

### 🎯 "Bullseye" Targets (High Probability)

| Program & Window | Insider Leverage | Judge's Perspective | Action |
|------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Disney Entertainment** (May-June) | "Home Team" — Already in family via *Not Dead Yet*, understands ABC Tone | "He's vetted. HR knows him. Easy win." | Personal Statement mentions *NDY* as "masterclass in ABC family dynamic" |
| **NBC Launch** (Aug-Sept) | "Improv DNA" — NBC worships Second City/Groundlings pipeline | "He speaks Tina Fey/Mike Schur language. Can 'Yes And' in a room." | Highlight improv training in bio first paragraph; submit ensemble pilot |

### 🌟 "Visionary" Targets (Prestige)

| Program & Window | Insider Leverage | Judge's Perspective | Action |
|------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **WB Discovery Access** (June-July) | "HBO/Streamer Pivot" — Specificity and edge | "Unique layered POV. Perspective we don't have. Feels 'Premium'." | Submit edgier material; essay focuses on "truth" and "cultural friction" |

### 🎓 "Credential" Targets (Mentorship)

| Program & Window | Insider Leverage | Judge's Perspective | Action |
|------------------|------------------|---------------------|--------|
| **Paramount Writers** (April-May) | "Professional Polish" — Work ethic as selling point | "He's an adult. Won't flake. Can put him in front of execs." | Frame around "refining craft" and humility |

## 5. The Council Deliberation (8 Expert Perspectives)

### Expert Panel

| Expert | Domain | Key Insight |
|--------|--------|-------------|
| **Lara Acosta** | Positioning | Josh lacks clear positioning statement. Needs: "Comedy writer whose actor experience makes dialogue production-ready from page one" |
| **Tom Noske** | Personal Brand | Currently "Valuable & Boring" — needs to become "Magnetic" with origin story |
| **Monk.Ai** | Offer Architecture | Application IS an offer. First page of script is Entry Offer. Build trust before formal app |
| **Oren** | Taste & Quality | Gap Confrontation needed — compare Josh's sample to past winners |
| **Jim O'Shaughnessy** | Strategy | Four Horsemen Audit revealed "Hope" blocker — frozen on Greg Daniels follow-up |
| **Jeremy Miner** | Identity Persuasion | Materials read "Striver" — needs "Inevitable" energy |
| **Shaan Puri** | Narrative | Need the "5-Second Moment" — exact pivot point in writing journey |
| **Mitch Albom** | Writing Craft | Theme-First: What's pilot about in <10 words? Apply Tight Cut |

### The Strategy 2.0 Sequence

1. **OPEN** with the 5-Second Moment (immediate emotional hook)
2. **GROUND** with Origin Story/Iceberg (vulnerability creates trust)
3. **STACK** Authority (credentials confirm the feeling)
4. **CLOSE** with Inevitable Energy ("this is already who I am")

## 6. The Greg Daniels Breakthrough

> **Critical Discovery:** Josh gave Greg Daniels (The Office, Upload) a script ~2 years ago. Greg read it, said Josh was a good writer, and gave specific notes. Josh **froze** — didn't know how to follow up.

### Four Horsemen Audit Results

| Horseman | Finding |
|----------|---------|
| **Fear** | ✅ Present but valid — 8 years writing, manager not moving, real stagnation |
| **Greed** | ❌ Not present — wants outcomes, not titles |
| **Hope** | ⚠️ **KEY ISSUE** — Hoped Greg Daniels moment would become something without follow-through |
| **Ignorance** | ⚠️ **KEY ISSUE** — Didn't know HOW to follow up (learnable) |

**The Insight:** The problem isn't talent — Greg Daniels confirmed that. The problem is Josh had access and didn't know how to use it.

### The Two Paths

| Path A: Fellowship (Stranger Lottery) | Path B: Warm Reactivation (Direct) |
|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------|
| Apply to Disney, NBC, WB, Paramount | Reconnect with Greg Daniels |
| Compete against thousands | Map existing network from sets |
| Wait 6+ months | One warm intro = 100 cold applications |
| If selected: instant credentialing | If it works: faster than any fellowship |

**Recommendation:** Do both. Prioritize Path B — it's already open.

---

## 7. Warm Reactivation Protocol

### Step 1: Find Original Notes
- [ ] Locate Greg's feedback on script
- [ ] Read fresh
- [ ] Note which implemented vs. didn't

### Step 2: Implement the Notes
Even after 2 years, complete the revisions. This closes the loop.
- [ ] Revise script with his specific feedback
- [ ] Make it undeniable — this is the version he said to write

### Step 3: Send Reactivation Message

> Greg — Two years ago you gave me notes on [SCRIPT NAME]. I finally implemented them.
>
> Your feedback on [SPECIFIC THING] completely changed how I approached the story. I wanted to say thank you.
>
> If you're ever curious how it turned out, I'd be happy to share. Either way, grateful for the time you gave me back then.

**Rules:**
- ❌ Don't ask for anything
- ❌ Don't apologize for delay
- ❌ Don't make it about needing something

## 8. Industry-Ready Bios

### Fellowship Bio (Full Narrative)
> **Josh Banday** is a writer, actor, and improviser known for his series regular roles as 'Ivan' on Amazon's *Upload* and 'Dennis' on ABC's *Not Dead Yet*. A Second City and Groundlings alum, Josh has spent his career bringing warmth and timing to other people's words—now, he's writing his own.
>
> Born Black, Filipino, Mexican, and Jewish, and raised in the LGBTQ+ community, Josh writes 'Code-Switching Comedy'—stories that explore the hilarious friction of belonging everywhere and nowhere. His work combines the structural precision of a seasoned improviser with the on-set fluency of a working actor. Currently developing two comedy pilots and an animated feature, Josh enters the 2026 fellowship cycle to transition from scene-stealer to showrunner, aiming to create television that isn't just diverse by default, but specific by design.

### "Showrunner" Bio (Pro Vibe)
> **Josh Banday** (*Upload*, *Not Dead Yet*) is a Black-Filipino-Mexican-Queer writer/actor transitioning from series regular to series creator. He writes genre-bending comedies about the chaos of intersectional identity, blending the rhythm of his Second City improv roots with the polish of a network TV veteran. His goal is to bring the 'set-readiness' of a seasoned performer to the writer's room.

### Elevator Pitch (Hook)
> I'm a series regular on *Upload* and *Not Dead Yet*, but my background is Second City improv. I write comedy about being Black, Filipino, Mexican, Jewish, and Queer—basically, I write about the chaos of trying to fit in when you check every single box.

---

## 9. Personal Statement Template

### Section 1: The "Call Sheet" Hook
**Objective:** Establish authority immediately. Put the reader on a set.

> "I am standing on the set of *Upload*, watching [Co-Star] do a take. The line is funny. The crew is laughing. I'm laughing. But in my head, I'm rewriting the scene. Not because it's bad—Greg Daniels is a genius—but because there is a specific, nuanced joke about the Black/Filipino intersection that *only I know* is missing. And I realized: I can spend my life selling the joke, or I can start building the world where the joke lives."

### Section 2: The "Improv" Transformation
**Objective:** Prove "Diversity" isn't just who you are, it's how you create.

> "Growing up Black, Filipino, Mexican, Jewish, and Queer in Catholic School wasn't just 'diverse'—it was an improv class I couldn't drop. I learned early that survival meant reading the room instantly. Which version of me does this scene need? That's Code-Switching. But it's also **Writing**."

### Section 3: The "Visionary" Pivot
**Objective:** Tell them what they're buying.

> "I am writing for the 'In-Betweeners.' The generation too Black for the 'nerds' but too 'alt' for the mainstream. My comedy sits at the friction point where identity politics meets actual human messiness."

### Section 4: The "De-Risked" Close
**Objective:** Reassure them you are safe.

> "I am not looking for a fellowship to teach me how to be a professional; the last five years of call times have taught me that. I am looking for a fellowship to champion my transition from Interpreter to Creator. I am ready for the room because I have been listening at the door for years. Now, I'm ready to open it."

## 10. Homework / Next Actions

### Must Complete
- [ ] **Greg Daniels Notes** — Find original notes, list implemented vs. not, start revisions
- [ ] **Network Map** — List 5+ people from Upload/NDY/sets, rate warmth, identify top 3
- [ ] **The 5-Second Moment** — Write 2-3 paragraphs: "When did you KNOW you were a writer?" The specific day, scene, what happened.

### Optional But Valuable
- [ ] Find 1-2 publicly shared winning samples/essays
- [ ] Draft positioning statement: "I help [WHO] achieve [WHAT] through [HOW] so they can [OUTCOME]"

### Questions to Answer in Writing
1. Do you still have Greg Daniels' notes? What channel to reach him?
2. Who from set work is still in your phone/email that you haven't talked to about writing?
3. What's the specific moment you knew you were a WRITER, not an actor who writes?
4. What kind of comedy do you HATE? What would you never write?
5. If you woke up tomorrow as a staff writer, what would you do differently TODAY?

---

## 11. The Reframe

You've been treating your career like a lottery: write scripts, submit to gatekeepers, hope someone notices.

**Greg Daniels already noticed.** The door is cracked. The question isn't whether you're good enough—he answered that. The question is whether you'll walk through.

> Fellowships are the backup plan. Your network is the main play.
