# AGENTS.md — Antigravity System Harness

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

---

## Environment Setup

- **`.env` at project root** with `NOTION_API_KEY` — required for all Notion operations
- Python deps: `python-dotenv`, `requests` (no requirements.txt; install manually)
- No build step, no test suite — this is an AI orchestration system, not a traditional app

## Notion API — Critical Version Pin

`@notionhq/client` v5.9.0 uses a newer API that returns `data_sources` instead of `properties`. Schema updates silently succeed but don't persist; row inserts fail.

**Always use `execution/notion_api.py`** (pins `Notion-Version: 2022-06-28`). Never use the JS client. Database IDs and schemas: `directives/notion-databases.md`.

## Running Execution Scripts

All from project root. Check `execution/` for existing tools before creating new ones.

```bash
python execution/notion_api.py query <database_id>
python execution/notion_api.py capture "Title" "Body" --type Task --tags Revenue,Urgent
python execution/parallel_swarm.py "objective"       # --grounded, --research
python execution/generate_image.py "prompt"
python execution/skill_converter.py
python execution/sync_registries.py
```

## Directory Conventions

- **Skills** (`skills/[name]/`): `SKILL.md` + `genius.md` + `workflows/*.md` (completion engine format)
- **Agents** (`agents/[name]/`): `AGENT.md` + `memory/` directory
- **Agent framework** (`agents/_framework/`): `invocation-cards.md`, `AGENT_TEMPLATE.md`, `orchestrator.md`
- **Workflows** (`.agent/workflows/`): Workflow implementations — invoked via `/extract`, `@extract`, "run extract", or bare name. System reads `.agent/workflows/extract.md`

## File Organization

- `.tmp/` — intermediates (never commit)
- `execution/` — deterministic Python scripts (API calls, data processing)
- `directives/` — SOPs and protocols
- `extractions/` — raw extraction reports and transcripts (per expert)
- `knowledge/` — organized knowledge base (books, frameworks, MES 3.0)
- `councils/` — council configurations (ai, brand, content, creative, revenue)
- `research_outputs/` — research project outputs
- `strategy_briefs/` — McKinsey-grade strategic dossiers
- `deliverables/` — client/project deliverables
- `products/` — product builds (e.g., PromptBase)
- `projects/` — active project workspaces
- Deliverables → cloud services (Google Sheets/Slides)

## Artifact-First Delivery Rule (HARD RULE — No Exceptions)

Every deliverable the user needs to review MUST be published as a **conversation artifact** (in the `brain/<conversation-id>/` directory with `IsArtifact: true`), not only as a raw workspace file.

- **All reports, briefs, trend reports, research outputs, analyses, strategy documents, and any file the user will read** → conversation artifact FIRST. This is the primary deliverable.
- A workspace copy (to `strategy_briefs/`, `research_outputs/`, `deliverables/`, etc.) may also be saved for LLM portability and file-system persistence — this is the secondary copy.
- Use GitHub-style alert boxes (`NOTE`, `TIP`, `IMPORTANT`, `WARNING`, `CAUTION`) for key callouts.
- Use blockquotes, strikethrough, visual hierarchy, and clean table formatting to make documents scannable and premium.
- **Never deliver a user-facing deliverable as only a workspace file.** If the user will read it, it gets an artifact.
- Exceptions: pure system files (configs, scripts, logs, `.py`, `.json`).

# The Chain (Every Request — No Exceptions)

Complete these 6 steps IN ORDER for every user request that produces a deliverable. There is no skip path for the chain itself — individual steps may narrow (see table below), but the chain always runs.

### Step 1: SCORE intent (1-5)
+1 Deliverable | +1 Audience | +1 Context/constraints | +1 End state | +1 Specific language.
Always score. Even Score 5 requests get scored — the number informs routing depth.

### Step 2: SHARPEN (if Score ≤ 3)
Ask missing DICE dimensions. One round max. Fill in inferences, confirm.
Details: `directives/intent-pipeline.md` Stage 2.

### Step 3: ROUTE to experts
Match domain → experts using table in `directives/intent-pipeline.md` Stage 3.
Check FARRICE.md proactive deployment table for auto-deploy signals (LinkedIn → Lara Acosta, etc.).
Multi-domain? Check ensemble patterns in `directives/expert_auto_routing.md`.
**Always route.** The result may be one Tier 1 expert, but the routing decision is explicit and logged.

### Step 4: LOAD via Context Engine
Tier 0 (cards) → Tier 1 (SKILL.md + workflow) → Tier 2 (+ genius.md) → Tier 3 (sub-agent).
Protocol: `directives/agent-loading-protocol.md`.
**Never produce expert-domain output without loading the expert first.**
For content: minimum 2 skill files loaded per `directives/content_creation_gate.md`.

### Step 5: PRODUCE output
Execute using loaded expert frameworks — their thinking, not their terminology.
During production, enforce `directives/quality_assurance.md` anti-patterns: entity classification, no phantom research, no template slop.

### Step 6: FINALIZE (Quality Gate + Log + Protocol Tracking — Single Call)
After producing expert output, score it mentally on 3 dimensions (1-10 each):
- **Intent Alignment**: Does it match what the user actually asked for?
- **Expert Standard**: Would the real expert recognize this as quality work?
- **Adversarial Resilience**: Would it survive critical scrutiny?

Then run the chain finalize command — this handles EVERYTHING (quality gate, regression check, Notion performance log, protocol activation tracking, session state):
```bash
python3 execution/chain_runner.py finalize "[what you produced]" \
    --expert [expert-name] \
    --skill [skill-directory-name] \
    --workflow [workflow-name] \
    --type [Content|Strategy|Research|Extraction|Client Work|System|Creative|Analysis] \
    --intent [1-10] --expert-score [1-10] --adversarial [1-10] \
    --notes "[what worked, what didn't]"
```
**If composite < 7 or any dimension < 6**: Retry the weakest section once, then re-finalize.
**This is non-negotiable.** Expert output without `finalize` is incomplete. This feeds the autoresearch loop — skipping it kills Phases 2-4.
Protocols: `directives/quality_gate.md`, `directives/feedback-ratchet.md`.

### Chain Narrowing Rules
- Score 4-5: Skip Step 2. Score ≤3: SHARPEN first.
- "Just do it": Route silently, skip PRESENT.
- Follow-up: Reuse Step 3 route.
- No deliverable (system commands): Chain does not apply.
- **"Trivial" is NOT a skip condition.** Content/strategy/research always runs the chain.
- Steps 1-3 are internalized (no file reads). Known routes: LinkedIn→Lara, Copy→Luke, SEO→Gotch, Brand→Oren/Grace, Ghost→Cole, Psychology→Kallaway, Consumer→Dai, Agentic→Saraev.
- Start Tier 1. Escalate to genius.md only for creative/complex or quality misses.
- FINALIZE fires only for expert-domain output.

### Workflow Override
If user invokes `/command`, `@command`, or bare name → read `.agent/workflows/[command].md` and execute.

## Architecture (3-Layer)

**Layer 1** (Directives): SOPs in `directives/` — what to do.
**Layer 2** (Orchestration): You — intelligent routing, decisions, error handling.
**Layer 3** (Execution): Deterministic Python in `execution/` — API calls, data processing.

Push complexity into deterministic code. You focus on decision-making.

**Knowledge Sources:**
- **Local Files**: Skills, agents, directives (primary)
- **Notion Databases**: 5 databases for projects, knowledge vault, content pipeline
- **NotebookLM**: Domain-specific research notebooks (RAG layer)
  - 5 notebooks: Higgsfield Cinema Studio, AI Brain Build Sprint, LinkedIn Ghostwriting, Lara Acosta, Luke Iha Copywriting
  - Query count: 100/month
  - Usage: `/query-notebook` or auto-loaded at Tier 1.5
  - Budget tracking: `.agent/notebooklm-usage.json`
- **Perplexity**: Real-time web research ($30/month)

**Key files (read on-demand, not preloaded):**
- `COUNCIL.md` — 24 experts + 5 standing councils. Read for expert selection.
- `DOMAIN_REGISTRY.md` — Expert swim lanes + compound pairing. Read for routing.
- `JARVIS.md` — Expert invocation protocol. Read for multi-expert workflows.
- `FARRICE.md` — Personal context, identity, voice. Read for content/brand work.

## Context Engine

**Tiered loading chain — check Hot first, then start at Tier 0, escalate only when needed.**

| Tier | What to Read | Token Cost | When |
|------|-------------|-----------|------|
| **Hot** | Nothing (already loaded) | 0 | Expert was loaded earlier this conversation |
| **0 — Card** | `agents/_framework/invocation-cards.md` | ~80 | Routing, ensemble selection |
| **1 — Standard** | SKILL.md + specific workflow | ~1,350 | Single expert, clear task |
| **2 — Deep** | SKILL.md + genius.md + workflow | ~2,550 | Creative/complex work |
| **3 — Sub-Agent** | Spawn sub-agent (fresh context) | ~300 main | Multi-expert, 10+ files loaded |

**Hot Context Rule**: Before loading any expert, check if they were already loaded this conversation. If hot at Tier 1 and Tier 2 is needed, only read genius.md (incremental). If hot at Tier 2, skip all reads. Anti-pattern: re-reading SKILL.md for the same expert twice in one conversation (~1,350 tokens wasted).

**Never rely on general training when expert skills exist.** Route via invocation cards first. Routing: `DOMAIN_REGISTRY.md` + `directives/expert_auto_routing.md`. Full protocol: `directives/agent-loading-protocol.md`.

---

## Directives

All SOPs live in `directives/`. Fire at trigger point — do NOT preload. List `directives/` to discover available protocols. Key ones: `quality_assurance.md` (Step 5), `quality_gate.md` (after Step 5), `content_creation_gate.md` (Step 4 gate), `agent-loading-protocol.md` (Step 4 loading), `intent-pipeline.md` (Step 2-3), `session-state-protocol.md` (after major decisions).

**Session state**: Write `.agent/session-state.md` after intent validation, expert deployment, major decisions, or 10+ file reads. Read after compaction or returning from sub-agents.
