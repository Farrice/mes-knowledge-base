## WHAT IS NOT VERIFIED

The following claims are **NOT supported by external data** and should not be used in marketing:

| Claim | Why It's Unverified |
|-------|---------------------|
| Specific client acquisition timelines | No data on how long it takes to get first client |
| Audit-to-implementation conversion rates | No external data found |
| Specific revenue outcomes from offers | Would need your own case studies |

---

## FRAMEWORK GUIDANCE [NOT DATA]

The MES 3.0 extractions provide **strategic structure**, not statistical proof:

- **Monk AI**: Offer pyramid architecture (entry → audit → implementation)
- **Lara Acosta**: LinkedIn content frameworks (4-3-2-1 rhythm, hook patterns)
- **Lindsay**: Lead generation channel strategy (5 channels)
- **AI Chris Lee**: Proof-building methodology without testimonials
- **SooWei**: Leverage hierarchy and calendar architecture

These frameworks are **valuable for execution** but the example outputs within them are **illustrative, not case studies**.
