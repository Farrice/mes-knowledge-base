## LINKEDIN CONTENT STRATEGY (Lara Acosta + Lindsay Synthesis)

### The 4-3-2-1 Weekly Rhythm
- **4 value posts** (how-tos, frameworks, insights)
- **3 authority posts** (case studies, results, proof)
- **2 personal posts** (story, journey, perspective)
- **1 promotional post** (offer, CTA, booking link)

### First Week Content Calendar

| Day | Post Type | Topic |
|-----|-----------|-------|
| Mon | Value | "The 3 prompt mistakes that make AI content sound robotic" |
| Tue | Authority | "I audited my own LinkedIn and found $X in missed opportunities" |
| Wed | Value | "How to capture your voice so AI writes like you" |
| Thu | Personal | "Why I went from [previous career] to AI content strategist" |
| Fri | Authority | "The exact prompt I use to generate a week of content in 30 minutes" |
| Sat | Value | "Most consultants use ChatGPT wrong. Here's the fix." |
| Sun | Promo | "I help B2B consultants create a month of LinkedIn content in 2 hours. DM 'SYSTEM' for details." |

### Hook Engineering Patterns

**Pattern 1: The Counterintuitive Claim**
> *"The best LinkedIn content isn't written by humans. It's written by AI that sounds more human than most humans."*

**Pattern 2: The Specific Number**
> *"I generated 47 LinkedIn posts in 2 hours last Tuesday. Here's the exact system."*

**Pattern 3: The Identity Challenge**
> *"If you're still manually writing every LinkedIn post, you're not a consultant — you're a content creator who consults on the side."*

---

## PROOF-BUILDING STRATEGY (AI Chris Lee Framework)

### If You Have ZERO Clients:

**Option 1: Self-Test Proof**
1. Run the AI Content System on YOUR OWN LinkedIn
2. Document before/after metrics (engagement, profile views, DMs)
3. Create 5-minute Loom showing the transformation
4. This IS your case study

**Option 2: Audit Proof**
1. Pick 3 LinkedIn profiles of potential ICP clients
2. Record 3-minute audits showing what they're missing
3. Use these as proof of diagnostic capability
4. Send audit TO the person (proof-first outreach)

**Option 3: Friend/Family Proof**
1. Build the system for someone you know
2. Document their results
3. Ask for introduction to their network

### The 5-Section Loom Framework

1. **Who + What** (15 sec): "I'm [name], I help [ICP] with [outcome]"
2. **Before State** (30 sec): "Here's what the LinkedIn profile looked like before..."
3. **Solution Built** (60 sec): "Here's the prompt system I created..."
4. **Outcome Achieved** (30 sec): "After 30 days, engagement increased by X%..."
5. **CTA** (15 sec): "If you want this for your profile, book a call at [link]"
