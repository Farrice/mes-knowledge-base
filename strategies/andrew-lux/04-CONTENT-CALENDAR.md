## Content Templates

### Mashup Video Template

**Duration:** 15-60 seconds

**Structure:**
```
[0-3 sec] HOOK: Text overlay + movement toward decks
[3-10 sec] BUILD: Establish Song A, hands on controller
[10-15 sec] REVEAL: The transition/mashup moment
[15-30+ sec] PAYOFF: Let it ride, show it works
```

**Text overlay examples:**
- "What if [Song A] was actually a bass house banger?"
- "[Song A] x [Song B] — this shouldn't work but..."
- "POV: You asked me to remix [Song A]"
- "Nobody asked for this mashup but here we go"

**Hashtags (rotate):**
```
#mashup #djmashup #remix #basshouse #fyp #[songA] #[songB]
```

### Coastal Cuts Template

**Duration:** 60-90 seconds

**Structure:**
```
[0-3 sec] HOOK: Establishing shot of location (sunset, palm trees, ocean)
[3-10 sec] SETUP: Andrew at decks, California aesthetic
[10-70 sec] THE MIX: 2-3 track blend, showing skill
[70-90 sec] CLOSE: Call to action ("What should I mix next?")
```

**Location checklist:**
- Sunset visible or implied (golden hour)
- Palm trees or California landmark in frame
- Ocean or city visible if possible

[3-60 sec] STORY: Authentic, vulnerable, specific details
[60-90 sec] REFLECTION: What it means now, lesson learned
```

**Story beats to cover (one per episode):**
1. The moment music clicked (Love Festival 2014)
2. DJing in Navy barracks
3. The $100K decision
4. Pandemic survival
5. Meeting AC Slater / Night Bass breakthrough

```

## Batch Production Strategy

### The 2-Hour Studio Block

Once per week, batch create content:

**Hour 1: Mashups**
- Create 3-4 mashups back-to-back
- Don't worry about filming yet
- Focus on audio quality

**Hour 2: Filming**
- Film all mashup videos
- Film 1-2 studio clips
- Film Coastal Cuts if location available

**Result:** 5-6 pieces of content in 2 hours

### The Coastal Cuts Expedition

Once every 2 weeks:
- Drive to 2-3 California locations
- Film 3-4 Coastal Cuts episodes
- Capture B-roll for other content
- Stock up for the next 2 weeks

### The Origin Story Day

One dedicated session:
- Script all 5 origin story episodes
- Film all in one sitting
- Edit and schedule over 5 weeks

---

## Emergency Content (When Stuck)

### Low-Effort, High-Impact Options

- Repost a previous mashup with "This one still hits" caption
- Duet/stitch another DJ's content with reaction
- "What should I remix next?" poll
- Throwback performance footage
- Simple "studio vibes" clip with music playing

### Trend-Jack Emergency Protocol

When something goes super viral:
1. Drop everything
2. Create mashup within 4 hours
3. Post immediately
4. Ride the wave

## 90-Day Metrics Targets

| Metric | Day 30 | Day 60 | Day 90 |
|--------|--------|--------|--------|
| IG Followers | 8,500 | 12,000 | 18,000 |
| TikTok Followers | 3,000 | 8,000 | 15,000 |
| Spotify MLs | 6,000 | 10,000 | 18,000 |
| Content pieces | 32 | 64 | 96 |
| Viral posts (100K+) | 0-1 | 1-2 | 2-4 |
| Discord members | 75 | 175 | 350 |

These are aggressive but achievable with consistent execution.

---

## The Non-Negotiables

**Every week, NO MATTER WHAT:**
- [ ] Minimum 2 mashups posted
- [ ] Minimum 1 Coastal Cuts posted
- [ ] Respond to all comments same day
- [ ] Check trends at least 3x
- [ ] Cross-post everything to all platforms

**The compound effect only works if you don't skip weeks.**

Consistency > Perfection.
