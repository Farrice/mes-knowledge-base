# Andrew Lux: The Mashup Factory Playbook

## The Thesis

Mashups are the highest-probability viral play for DJs on TikTok. They tap into existing audiences for both songs, they're fast to produce, and they create the "unexpected delight" that algorithms reward.

**The math:**
- DJ Lilli: 0 → 100K followers in 2 weeks (mashups)
- Billy Gillies: "DNA (Loving You)" → 127M streams, UK Top 10 (mashup)
- Jovynn: 0 → 10.4M followers (mashup content)

Andrew doesn't need to invent new content formats. He needs to execute this one relentlessly.

## The Production Process

### Jovynn's Actual Workflow

> "The most time-consuming part is thinking of the best match. Executing a short mashup only takes 10-15 minutes."

**What this means for Andrew:**
- Batch the thinking (brainstorm 10 mashup ideas in one session)
- Batch the production (execute 3-5 mashups in one studio session)
- The constraint isn't production time—it's idea generation

### The 15-Minute Mashup Formula

**Step 1: Identify the pairing (5 min)**
- One song trending on TikTok + one unexpected pairing
- Check key and BPM compatibility (use Tunebat, Mixed In Key, or AudioKeychain)
- Trust your ear—if it sounds good, it IS good

**Step 2: Find the transition point (3 min)**
- Where do syllables or sounds naturally lead into the other song?
- The reveal moment should feel inevitable, not forced
- Usually works best when melodic phrases align

**Step 3: Execute in DAW or DJ software (5 min)**
- Use stem separation (now built into Serato, rekordbox, Virtual DJ)
- Isolate vocals from Song A, beat from Song B (or vice versa)
- Align, adjust tempo if needed, done

**Step 4: Export 60-90 second clip (2 min)**
- Vertical format ready (1080x1920)
- Start AFTER the first song is established (don't waste time on intro)
- End on the payoff (the mashup working together)

### Recommended Production Stack

**For speed (DJ software):**
- djay Pro AI (creates mashup-ready content in under 60 seconds)
- Virtual DJ (real-time stem isolation)
- Serato (integrates with existing library)

**For polish (DAW):**
- Ableton Live (industry standard, now has stem separation in v12.3)
- Serato Studio (plays elements over source tracks)

**For key/BPM detection:**
- Mixed In Key 11 Pro
- Tunebat (free web tool)
- AudioKeychain

## What Makes Mashups Go Viral

### The 5 Viral Triggers

**1. Unexpected Song Pairing**
Songs that "shouldn't work together" but do.
- Diana Ross "I'm Coming Out" x Disturbed "Down With the Sickness"
- Bee Gees x Nelly
- "Circle of Life" x "Crazy in Love"

**Andrew's angle:** Bass house treatment on songs you'd never expect. Pop vocals over filthy bass. The contrast is the hook.

**2. Recognition + Surprise**
Use songs already popular on TikTok, combined with something unexpected. The brain rewards familiar + novel simultaneously.

**3. The Perfect Transition Point**
Find where syllables and sounds naturally lead into each other. The best mashups feel "meant to be."

**4. Sped-Up Versions**
TikTok is fast-paced. Sped-up versions let listeners "stick through the best parts." This is why sped-up remixes dominate the platform.

**5. Emotional Hook**
60% of successful music TikToks feature emotional hooks. Nostalgia works extremely well—songs from different eras together.

### What to AVOID

- Overly complex turntablism (average viewers don't care)
- Long intros or unnecessary buildup
- Misleading hooks that don't deliver
- Copyright-struck songs (check before posting)

## The Content Format

### Video Structure (15-60 seconds)

**Opening (0-3 seconds) — THE HOOK**
This is your "audition for broader distribution." Videos with 65%+ 3-second retention get 4-7x more impressions.

Options:
- Text overlay: "What if [Song A] was actually a bass house banger?"
- Movement: Hands reaching for decks
- Bold claim: "This shouldn't work but trust me"

**The Build (3-10 seconds)**
- Establish Song A (make it recognizable within 2-3 seconds)
- Show your hands on the controller (authenticity signal)
- Build visual anticipation

**The Transition/Reveal (10-15 seconds)**
- The "magic moment" where songs blend
- This is the shareability moment
- Your facial reaction adds human element

**The Payoff (15-30+ seconds)**
- Let the mashup ride
- Show it works together
- Loop back or show full blend

### Visual Requirements

- **Aspect ratio:** 9:16 (vertical)
- **Resolution:** 1080x1920 minimum
- **Show your hands:** Authenticity matters
- **Text overlay required:** Many scroll with sound off
- **Minimal production needed:** Jovynn says "Professional videography isn't necessary. TikTok appreciates organic content."

## Hashtag Strategy

### Core Tags (use 3-4 every post)
```
#mashup #djmashup #remix #djtransition #basshouse
```

### Discovery Tags (rotate)
```
#fyp #viral #trending #foryou
```

### Niche Tags (when relevant)
```
#nightbass #housemusic #techhouse #edm #rave
```

### Song-Specific Tags
Always tag the original songs:
```
#[songname] #[artistname]
```

### Volume Strategy
- 3-6 hashtags per post (not more)
- Test different combinations
- Track which drive views (TikTok Analytics)

## The Trend-Jacking Protocol

When something goes viral, Andrew should be remixing it within 24-48 hours.

### Daily Monitoring (10 min/day)

**Check:**
1. TikTok Search → "viral sound" → Sounds tab
2. TikTok Creative Center → Trends → Songs
3. Spotify "TikTok" playlists
4. What other mashup DJs are using

### Speed Execution

- See trend Monday morning
- Produce mashup Monday afternoon
- Post Tuesday (while trend is still rising)

**The window is small.** TikTok trends can peak and fade in days. Jump on rising sounds, not already-peaked sounds.

### The "Bootleg Bomb" Variant

For songs that can't be posted on TikTok due to copyright:

1. Create the full bass house bootleg
2. Tease the drop on TikTok (15-30 seconds)
3. Drive traffic to SoundCloud for full version
4. SoundCloud is where bootlegs live safely

## Metrics to Track

### Leading Indicators (Check Daily)
- Views in first hour
- 3-second retention rate (if available)
- Comment volume
- Shares (most important signal)

### Lagging Indicators (Check Weekly)
- Follower growth
- Average views per post
- Best-performing mashup of the week
- Profile visits

### Success Benchmarks

| Timeframe | Target |
|-----------|--------|
| Week 1-4 | Find posting rhythm, 1-2 mashups/week |
| Month 2 | 3 mashups/week, identify what resonates |
| Month 3 | 3-4 mashups/week, first viral hit (100K+ views) |
| Month 6 | Consistent 50K+ views per post, 25K+ followers |

---

## The Compound Effect

Jovynn posted consistently for 5 years to build 10.4M followers.

**The formula is simple:**
- More mashups = more chances to go viral
- More chances = eventual breakthrough
- Breakthrough = algorithm favor for future posts

**Andrew's advantage:** He has the production skills (Icon Collective, Night Bass releases). Most TikTok DJs don't. His mashups can be BETTER, not just more frequent.

Quality + Quantity + Consistency = Inevitable growth.

## Quick Reference: Daily Checklist

- [ ] Check TikTok trending sounds (5 min)
- [ ] Identify 1-2 potential mashup pairings
- [ ] If good pairing found, produce immediately (15 min)
- [ ] Film and post (10 min)
- [ ] Cross-post to IG Reels
- [ ] Engage with comments (10 min)
- [ ] Note what performed, what didn't

**Total daily time investment: 30-45 minutes**

The DJs who win aren't necessarily the most talented. They're the most consistent.

*"The least effort thing seems to resonate with people... the average music consumer doesn't care about super crazy turntablism."* — DJ Habibeats (1.5M followers)

Keep it simple. Keep it frequent. Let the algorithm do its job.
