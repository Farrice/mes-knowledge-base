# Andrew Lux Content Strategy Proposal

**Prepared by:** Farrice Cain, MES Consulting
**Date:** January 2026
**For:** Andrew Lux

---

## Executive Summary

Andrew, you have something rare: **industry validation without mainstream visibility.**

Night Bass releases. IN/ROTATION placements. Support from Skrillex, Fred Again, Diplo, and Four Tet. You've performed at Nocturnal Wonderland, Academy LA, and Echostage.

But you have ~4,800 Spotify monthly listeners and ~7,400 Instagram followers.

**The industry already respects you. The audience doesn't know you yet.**

This proposal outlines a systematic content strategy to close that gap and position you for Cosmic Meadow at EDC Las Vegas within 24 months.

## The Opportunity

### Where You Are

| Asset | Current State |
|-------|--------------|
| Label placements | Night Bass, IN/ROTATION, House Call, Nightenjin |
| Industry support | Skrillex, Fred Again, Diplo, Four Tet, Benny Benassi |
| Venue resume | Academy LA, Avalon, Echostage, Nocturnal Wonderland |
| Origin story | Navy vet → $100K job → LA grind → Night Bass |
| Spotify monthly listeners | ~4,800 |
| Instagram followers | ~7,400 |

### Where You Need to Be (for Cosmic Meadow consideration)

| Metric | Required | Gap |
|--------|----------|-----|
| Spotify monthly listeners | 1M+ | 208x growth needed |
| Instagram followers | 300K+ | 40x growth needed |
| TikTok followers | 100K+ | Building from near-zero |
| Signature track streams | 50M+ | Need breakout moment |

### The Insight

You're operating in the old paradigm: release tracks → hope for streams → wait for bookings.

The new paradigm is: **create content → build audience → leverage attention into streams and bookings.**

John Summit, Dom Dolla, FISHER—they all understood this. Their content machines drove their breakouts, not just their music quality.

---

## The Strategy

### Phase 1: Content Velocity (Months 1-3)

**Goal:** Establish consistent content rhythm, build recognition

**Weekly Output:**
- 3 Mashup videos (highest viral potential)
- 2 "Coastal Cuts" signature format episodes
- 2 Studio/behind-the-scenes clips
- 1 Origin story or personality piece

**Total: 8-10 pieces of content per week across TikTok, Instagram, YouTube Shorts**

**Why mashups?** DJ Lilli went 0 → 100K in 2 weeks with mashups. Billy Gillies got 127M streams on a mashup. They tap into existing audiences and have the highest probability of viral breakthrough.

**Why "Coastal Cuts"?** Every breakout artist has a signature format. This positions your "California bass house" identity and creates recognizable, repeatable content.

### Phase 2: Viral Bets (Months 4-6)

**Goal:** Chase breakout moments while maintaining consistency

- Trend-jacking protocol (remix trending sounds within 48 hours)
- Bootleg bombs (bass house flips of pop hits, drive to SoundCloud)
- Collaboration cascade (leverage your industry connections)
- Cross-platform amplification

### Phase 3: Conversion Architecture (Months 7-12)

**Goal:** Convert attention to owned audience and bookings

- Discord community ("Lux Lounge")
- Email list with lead magnet
- Pre-save campaigns for releases
- Discovery Project submission
- Agency pitch preparation

---

## The Deliverables

### Strategic Foundation
- Complete brand positioning document
- Visual identity system (color palette, typography, guidelines)
- 90-day content calendar with daily breakdown
- Content templates for all formats

### Deep-Dive Playbooks
- **Mashup Factory Playbook:** Exact process for creating viral mashup content
- **Visual Brand System:** Complete guidelines for consistent aesthetic
- **Discovery Project Strategy:** Optimized submission approach
- **EDC Pathway Roadmap:** Benchmarks and milestones to main stage

### Ongoing Support (if retained)
- Weekly content strategy calls
- Performance analytics review
- Trend identification and opportunities
- Monthly strategy adjustments

---

## What Makes This Different

### Not Generic Music Marketing

Most music marketers focus on:
- Spotify playlist pitching
- Facebook ads for streams
- PR and blog coverage

These are tactics. They don't build career-changing audience growth.

### A DJ-Specific Content System

This strategy is built specifically for electronic music artists in the "almost breaking through" phase. It's informed by:

- Research on every major DJ breakout of the past 5 years (John Summit, Dom Dolla, FISHER, etc.)
- Deep analysis of what's working on TikTok for DJs right now
- Understanding of the Insomniac ecosystem and EDC booking patterns
- Your specific assets (Navy story, Night Bass credibility, California aesthetic)

### Built on Your Existing Strengths

You don't need to become someone else. You need to systematize what you already have:

| Your Asset | How We Leverage It |
|------------|-------------------|
| Production skills | Faster, better mashups than competitors |
| Night Bass credibility | Proof of quality in all positioning |
| Navy origin story | Emotional content that builds connection |
| California lifestyle | "Coastal Cuts" signature format |
| Industry connections | Collaboration and support opportunities |

## The ROI Case

### If This Works (Conservative Scenario)

**Month 6:**
- TikTok: 0 → 30K followers
- Instagram: 7.4K → 25K followers
- Spotify: 4.8K → 50K monthly listeners

**Month 12:**
- TikTok: 30K → 75K followers
- Instagram: 25K → 75K followers
- Spotify: 50K → 150K monthly listeners

**Value created:**
- Higher booking fees (demand = leverage)
- Label interest for bigger releases
- Discovery Project candidacy strengthened
- Agency attention

### If This Doesn't Work

You've built a content library and habits that will continue compounding. The downside is limited. The upside is career-changing.

---

## Why Now

### The Window Is Open

- TikTok's algorithm still rewards new creators who post consistently
- Mashup content is proven but not oversaturated in bass house
- You're already in the Insomniac ecosystem (IN/ROTATION)
- Your story is ready to be told

### The Window Closes

- Every day without content, competitors are posting
- Algorithms reward early movers
- The "almost breaking through" window doesn't last forever
- Industry attention fades without audience growth

---

## Next Steps

1. **Review this proposal** and the supporting strategy documents
2. **Schedule a call** to discuss questions and fit
3. **Choose an option** that matches your commitment level
4. **Begin immediately** — the best time to start was yesterday

## About Me

I'm Farrice Cain, founder of MES Consulting. I help artists stuck in the "almost breaking through" phase build systematic content strategies that close the gap between industry credibility and audience visibility.

My approach combines:
- Deep research into what's actually working (not theory)
- DJ/electronic music specific insights
- Systematic frameworks that create consistency
- AI-enhanced research and analysis

I built this strategy specifically for your situation after extensive research into your profile, the EDM landscape, and every major DJ breakout of the past 5 years.

---

## The Bottom Line

Andrew, you've already done the hard part. You made music good enough for Night Bass and got Skrillex to play your tracks.

Now you need to do the unsexy part: showing up every single day with content that builds audience.

This strategy gives you the system to do that. Whether you execute it yourself or with my support, the path is clear.

**The question isn't whether you can break through. It's whether you'll build the content machine that makes it inevitable.**

*"The DJs who win aren't necessarily the most talented. They're the most consistent."*
