# Andrew Lux: Discovery Project Submission Strategy

## What Is the Discovery Project?

- He has festival performance experience
- His credentials make him a STRONG candidate

## Andrew's Discovery Project Advantages

### He's Already in the Ecosystem

Most applicants are completely unknown to Insomniac. Andrew has:
- IN/ROTATION releases (Insomniac's label)
- Nocturnal Wonderland performance
- Label relationships (Night Bass, etc.)

This isn't starting from zero. This is formalizing a relationship that already exists.

### His Production Quality Is Proven

- Night Bass releases (AC Slater's curation)
- Support from Skrillex, Fred Again, Diplo, Four Tet
- Icon Collective education

Most Discovery Project submissions are bedroom producers hoping to get noticed. Andrew has professional-grade releases on respected labels.

### His Story Is Compelling

Navy veteran → Left $100K job → Survived pandemic broke → Grinded to LA → Night Bass signed

This is the kind of narrative Insomniac loves. It's authentic, it's earned, it shows dedication.

## The Submission Requirements

### What's Required

1. **Original track** (SoundCloud link)
2. **DJ mix** (SoundCloud or Mixcloud link)
3. **Completed application form**
4. **Must be US resident, 18+, valid tax ID**

### Selection Criteria

Insomniac states: "Selected artists chosen at Insomniac's sole discretion."

**What this actually means:**
- Production quality matters
- Uniqueness/memorability matters
- Story/narrative matters
- Social proof matters (even if not explicitly stated)
- Genre fit for their events matters

## Andrew's Submission Strategy

### Track Selection

**Don't submit just any track.** Choose strategically:

**Option A: Best-performing release**
- The track with most streams/support
- Proves market validation

**Option B: Most "Andrew Lux" track**
- The one that best represents his signature sound
- Shows clear artistic identity

**Option C: Unreleased banger**
- Something fresh that shows current level
- Risk: no external validation
- Reward: exclusive, exciting

**Recommendation:** Submit his strongest released track with external validation (Night Bass or IN/ROTATION release preferred). The existing relationship with IN/ROTATION is an advantage—submit something that extends that relationship.

### Mix Curation

The mix is where Andrew can really shine. This isn't just about track selection—it's about demonstrating:
- Technical DJ skills
- Musical curation/taste
- Energy management
- How he'd perform on an Insomniac stage

**Mix Strategy:**

1. **Length:** 30-60 minutes (check current requirements)

2. **Opening:** Start strong but not peak. Show dynamics understanding.

3. **Track selection:**
   - Include 1-2 Andrew Lux originals (showcase his production)
   - Include tracks from Insomniac ecosystem (IN/ROTATION, Bassrush, etc.)
   - Include tracks from artists who've supported him
   - Show range while maintaining coherent vibe

4. **Technical showcase:**
   - Clean transitions
   - At least 2-3 moments of technical skill (scratching, loops, mashups)
   - Don't overdo it—taste matters more than tricks

5. **Closing:** End memorable. The last 5 minutes matter most.

### The Application Itself

**Don't just fill in the blanks.** Use the narrative fields to tell the story:

**The story beats to hit:**
1. The transformation (Navy → Producer)
2. The sacrifice (Left $100K job)
3. The struggle (Pandemic nearly broke him)
4. The breakthrough (AC Slater/Night Bass recognition)
5. The mission (What he's building, why EDC matters)

**Keep it concise but memorable.** Reviewers read hundreds of applications.

### Timing

- Check when applications open (usually several months before EDC)
- Submit early in the window (shows eagerness)
- But not SO early that you're forgotten
- Sweet spot: First 2 weeks of application window

---

## Parallel Path: Build Leverage While Waiting

The Discovery Project is ONE path into EDC. Andrew should pursue multiple angles simultaneously:

### Path 1: Discovery Project (Official)
- Submit when applications open
- Follow up appropriately
- Hope for selection

### Path 2: IN/ROTATION Relationship
- Continue releasing on IN/ROTATION
- Build internal champions at Insomniac
- Ask about other Insomniac event opportunities

### Path 3: Bassrush Events
- Andrew makes bass music
- Bassrush is Insomniac's bass sub-brand
- Play Bassrush shows → internal visibility

### Path 4: Booking Agency
- Wasserman handles 25% of EDC bookings
- Getting signed creates direct access to bookers
- Research which agents handle artists at his level

### Path 5: Social Metrics
- The content strategy (mashups, Coastal Cuts, etc.)
- Build undeniable numbers
- Bookers check social proof

**The goal:** Don't rely on any single path. Create multiple opportunities for EDC to become inevitable.

## The Realistic Timeline

**If everything goes well:**

| Timeframe | Milestone |
|-----------|-----------|
| Now | Prepare submission materials |
| Application window | Submit Discovery Project |
| Months 1-6 | Continue content strategy, build metrics |
| Selection announcement | Hope for selection |
| If selected | Prepare for EDC performance |
| Post-EDC | Leverage the performance for next steps |

**If not selected:**

- Resubmit next year with stronger metrics
- Focus on alternative paths (Bassrush, other Insomniac events)
- Use the year to build undeniable social proof
- Discovery Project isn't the only way—it's the fastest way

---

## The Bigger Picture

Discovery Project is a tactic, not the strategy.

**The strategy is:** Become so undeniable that Insomniac HAS to book Andrew.

This happens through:
- Consistent content that builds audience
- Releases that get industry attention
- Shows that prove live performance ability
- Social metrics that demonstrate demand
- Relationships within the Insomniac ecosystem

Discovery Project can accelerate this. But even without it, the destination is the same. Andrew's job is to keep building regardless of any single opportunity.

---

## Summary

**Andrew's Discovery Project position:** Strong.

He has:
- IN/ROTATION releases (already in the ecosystem)
- Professional production quality
- Compelling origin story
- Festival performance experience

**The submission strategy:**
1. Submit strongest IN/ROTATION or Night Bass release
2. Curate a mix that demonstrates festival-ready skills
3. Tell the Navy → LA story compellingly
4. Submit early in the application window
5. Pursue parallel paths simultaneously

**The mindset:** Discovery Project is ONE opportunity. Andrew is building a career that creates MANY opportunities. Stay focused on the long game.
