# Producer-First Content Playbook

## For Artists Who Want to Be Known for Their Music, Not Their Personality

This playbook is for producers who:
- Don't enjoy being "on" for the camera
- Find dancing/trend videos draining
- Want their craft to speak for itself
- Are introverts who happen to make music

---

## The Core Principle

**Let the music do the work.**

Every piece of content should showcase SKILL and SOUND, not personality and performance.

---

## The Content Categories

### 1. Production Breakdowns (High Value)

**What it is:** Show how a sound, hook, or track was built

**Format:**
```
[0-5 sec] The finished sound/section
[5-45 sec] Building it layer by layer
[45-60 sec] The finished sound again
```

**Examples:**
- "How I made this bass sound"
- "The drop in 60 seconds"
- "From blank project to finished hook"

**Why it works:**
- Demonstrates mastery
- Provides value to other producers
- Algorithms reward watch time (people stay to see the result)
- Zero personality required

**Charlie Puth example:** His "Light Switch" production breakdown got 119.5M views. He didn't dance. He showed the process.

---

### 2. Studio Timelapses (Low Effort)

**What it is:** Record your session, speed it up, overlay with the final track

**Format:**
- Screen recording of DAW (Ableton, FL, Logic)
- Sped up 10-20x
- Final track as audio

**Why it works:**
- Shows dedication
- Hypnotic to watch
- Zero talking, zero personality
- Music is the star

**Pro tip:** Set up a second camera angle on your hands/controller for visual variety

---

### 3. Sample Flips (Skill Flex)

**What it is:** Take something unexpected and turn it into your sound

**Format:**
```
[0-3 sec] Original sample (text: "What if I flipped this into bass house?")
[3-30 sec] The transformation
[30-45 sec] The result
```

**Ideas:**
- Classical music → bass house
- 80s pop → modern production
- Unexpected vocal → chopped into hook
- Field recording → textured bass

**Why it works:**
- The transformation is inherently interesting
- Demonstrates production skill
- Creates "how did he do that?" curiosity

---

### 4. Before/After Sessions (Transformation Story)

**What it is:** Show evolution of a track over time

**Format:**
- "What this track sounded like at midnight" (raw version)
- "What it sounds like now" (polished version)

**Why it works:**
- Progress is inherently interesting
- Shows the work behind the finished product
- Normalizes iteration (relatable to other producers)

---

### 5. Sound Design Spotlights

**What it is:** Focus on one specific element and show how it was crafted

**Examples:**
- "This bass took 2 hours to get right. Here's why."
- "The secret sauce in this drop"
- "Why this synth sounds different"

**Format:**
- Isolate the element
- Show the processing chain
- A/B comparison (before processing / after)

---

### 6. Visualizers (Passive Music Promotion)

**What it is:** Audio + visual treatment instead of video of you

**Tools:**
- Revid.ai (AI-generated visuals synced to audio)
- EchoWave (50+ templates)
- SongRender (waveform visualizations)

**Why it works:**
- No face required
- Professional look
- Algorithms favor video over static images
- AI visualizers get 40% more engagement than static posts

**Use for:**
- New releases
- Unreleased previews
- Hook teases

---

### 7. Gear/Studio Content (Aesthetic + Credibility)

**What it is:** Your workspace as content

**Examples:**
- Close-up shots of synths/controllers
- "New arrival" posts when gear comes in
- Studio tour (can be silent with music overlay)

**Why it works:**
- @producer_setups has 116K followers doing only this
- Visual credibility marker
- Gear porn is genuinely interesting to music fans
- Zero personality required

---

### 8. Work in Progress Teases

**What it is:** Short clips of unreleased material

**Format:**
- 15-30 second clip of a drop or hook
- No context needed
- Maybe text overlay: "New one cooking"

**Why it works:**
- Builds anticipation
- Fans feel like insiders
- Requires nothing but the music

---

## The Weekly Rhythm

**Sustainable schedule for introverts:**

| Day | Content Type | Time Investment |
|-----|--------------|-----------------|
| Mon | Production breakdown | 30 min to edit |
| Wed | Studio timelapse or WIP tease | 15 min |
| Fri | Visualizer or sample flip | 30 min |
| Optional | Gear shot or behind-the-scenes | 5 min |

**Total: 4 posts per week, ~90 minutes of effort**

Compare to the "content creator" approach: 10+ posts, hours of filming, dancing, scripting, performing.

---

## What NOT to Do

### Stop Doing These:

- Dancing to your own music (unless you genuinely enjoy it)
- Trend-based content that requires performance
- "Day in the life" vlogs
- Face-to-camera talking unless it's about the craft
- Forced humor or goofy content
- Anything that makes you think "I hate doing this"

### Why:

- Inauthenticity is visible
- Burnout kills consistency
- The wrong audience will find you
- It's not sustainable

---

## Platform Notes

### TikTok
- Production clips can perform well
- Algorithm favors retention — show the payoff
- Don't force trends if they don't fit
- 45-60 seconds for breakdowns
- 15-30 seconds for teases

### Instagram Reels
- Cross-post from TikTok
- Feed posts for polished aesthetic content
- Stories for raw studio moments
- Grid aesthetic matters — curate it

### YouTube
- Long-form production content (tutorials, sessions)
- "How I made [track]" deep dives
- Algorithm rewards watch time
- Can be evergreen (people search for production tutorials)

### SoundCloud
- Bootlegs and remixes (copyright-friendly zone)
- Works in progress
- DJ mixes
- The underground platform

---

## The Visual System

### Since you're not showing face, show AESTHETIC

**Consistent elements:**
- Same color grading on all content
- Same fonts for text overlays
- Recognizable studio setup
- Maybe a simple logo/watermark

**The goal:** Someone scrolling should recognize your content before reading your name.

## Content Ideas Bank

### Quick Wins (Under 30 min to create)

- [ ] Screen record 5 minutes of production, speed up to 30 seconds
- [ ] Record just the drop of your latest track with visualizer
- [ ] Post a close-up of your favorite piece of gear with caption
- [ ] Share a before/after of any track in progress
- [ ] Tease a hook from something unreleased

### Medium Effort (30-60 min)

- [ ] Full production breakdown of one element
- [ ] Sample flip from unexpected source
- [ ] Studio timelapse of a full session
- [ ] "Making a beat in 60 seconds" challenge

### Higher Effort (Worth It)

- [ ] Full "making of" for a released track
- [ ] Collaboration content (if working with others)
- [ ] Ghost production reveal (if legally possible)
- [ ] Tutorial on signature technique

---

## The Mindset Shift

### From: "How do I get attention?"
### To: "How do I show what I can do?"

The content creator mindset is: entertain to get followers.

The producer mindset is: demonstrate to earn respect.

Different goals require different approaches.

---

## Measuring Success Differently

### Traditional metrics (follower count, views) matter less

### What matters more:
- Other producers watching and respecting
- Artists reaching out for production work
- Industry people in your comments/DMs
- Quality of attention, not quantity

### The long game:
- Build reputation among the right 1,000 people
- Those 1,000 are producers, artists, A&Rs, bookers
- They create opportunities that 100K random followers don't

---

## The Bottom Line

You don't have to become a content creator to succeed in music.

You have to show your work in a way that reaches people.

For producers, that means: **Let the craft be the content.**

No dancing required.
