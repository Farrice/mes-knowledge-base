## Sales Process

### Lead Qualification

**Questions to ask:**
1. What's your current follower count across platforms?
2. Do you have label releases or industry recognition?
3. What's your content posting frequency currently?
4. What's your goal in the next 12 months?
5. Are you willing to commit to posting 8+ times per week?
6. What's your budget for growth investment?

**Green lights:**
- Has some traction (not starting from zero)
- Clear ambition (festivals, bookings, streams)
- Willing to post consistently
- Has budget aligned with tiers

**Red flags:**
- Zero releases or performance history
- Not willing to create content
- Expects results without effort
- Budget is <$1,000 total

### The Sales Call Structure

**5 min: Build rapport**
- Learn about them as a person/artist
- Where are they based?
- How long have they been producing?

**10 min: Understand situation**
- Current metrics
- Current content habits
- What they've tried
- What's not working

**10 min: Understand goals**
- Where do they want to be in 12 months?
- Specific goals (EDC? Agency? Full-time?)
- Why now?

**10 min: Present solution**
- Diagnose the gap
- Explain the approach
- Share relevant case study (if available)
- Recommend specific tier

**10 min: Handle objections**
- Address concerns
- Answer questions
- Clarify deliverables

**5 min: Close or next steps**
- If ready: Send agreement, collect payment
- If not ready: Set follow-up date

### Objection Handling

**"It's too expensive."**
> "I understand. What would success be worth to you? If this strategy adds 50K followers and gets you booked at EDC, what's that worth to your career? The investment pays for itself with a single festival booking."

**"I can do this myself."**
> "You absolutely can. The question is: will you? Most artists know they should post more but don't have the system or accountability. That's what I provide. If you're confident you'll execute, Tier 1 gives you the plan."

**"I want to see results first."**
> "Totally fair. The reality is content marketing takes time—usually 3-6 months to see significant results. That's why Tier 2 has a 3-month minimum. I need enough time to prove the system works."

**"Can I start with Tier 1 and upgrade?"**
> "Absolutely. Many clients start with the Strategy Package, execute for a month, and realize they want more support. Upgrading is easy."
