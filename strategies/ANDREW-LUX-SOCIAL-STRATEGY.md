# Andrew Lux: Social Media & Career Breakthrough Strategy

## The Thesis

**Andrew Lux has a credibility-to-visibility gap.**

He has Night Bass releases. Insomniac's IN/ROTATION placements. Support from Skrillex, Fred Again, Diplo, and Four Tet. He's played Nocturnal Wonderland, Academy LA, Echostage.

But he has ~4,800 Spotify monthly listeners and ~7,400 Instagram followers.

**The industry knows him. The audience doesn't.**

This strategy closes that gap.

## Current State Analysis

### What Andrew Has (Strengths)

| Asset | Why It Matters |
|-------|----------------|
| **Night Bass releases** | AC Slater's label = bass house credibility |
| **IN/ROTATION (Insomniac)** | He's already IN the Insomniac ecosystem |
| **Support from A-listers** | Skrillex, Fred Again, Diplo, Four Tet, Benny Benassi |
| **Strong venue resume** | Academy LA, Avalon, Echostage, Nocturnal Wonderland |
| **Compelling origin story** | Navy vet who left $100K job, survived pandemic broke, grinded to LA |
| **Defined aesthetic** | "Coastal energy" + "LA Palm Trees & Disco Balls" |
| **Education** | Icon Collective + LA Film School = production chops |

### What Andrew Lacks (Gaps)

| Gap | Current | Benchmark for EDC Cosmic Meadow |
|-----|---------|--------------------------------|
| Spotify monthly listeners | ~4,800 | 1M+ |
| Instagram followers | ~7,400 | 300K+ |
| Signature viral track | None yet | 50M+ streams |
| Content consistency | Sporadic | 4-5x/week minimum |
| TikTok presence | Unclear | 100K+ followers |
| Visual brand clarity | Soft | Instantly recognizable |

### The Core Problem

Andrew is producing at a level above his audience size. The music is there. The credentials are there. **The content and distribution machine is not.**

He's relying on traditional pathways (release tracks → hope for streams) in a TikTok-first world.

---

## Strategic Framework: The Visibility Engine

### Phase 1: Content Velocity (Months 1-3)
Build the content habit. Create recognizable formats. Establish presence.

### Phase 2: Viral Bets (Months 4-6)
Deploy high-upside content strategies. Chase the breakout moment.

### Phase 3: Conversion Architecture (Months 7-12)
Convert attention to streams, fans, and bookings. Build owned channels.

---

## Phase 1: Content Velocity

### Platform Priority Stack

1. **TikTok** — Discovery engine. #1 priority.
2. **Instagram Reels** — Credibility + industry eyes. Cross-post TikTok content.
3. **YouTube Shorts** — Long-tail searchability. Repurpose.
4. **Discord** — Build superfan community early.

### The Content Mix (Weekly)

| Content Type | Frequency | Platform |
|--------------|-----------|----------|
| Mashups/Remixes | 2-3x/week | TikTok → IG → YT |
| Studio clips | 2x/week | TikTok → IG |
| Performance clips | 1-2x/week | All platforms |
| Personality/lifestyle | 1-2x/week | TikTok, IG Stories |
| Full mix (monthly) | 1x/month | YouTube, SoundCloud, Mixcloud |

**Total: 8-12 pieces of content per week across platforms.**

### The Signature Format: "Coastal Cuts"

Every breakthrough artist needs a recurring format. Tape B has "CarTunes." Andrew needs his version.

**Concept: "Coastal Cuts"**
- 60-90 second clips of Andrew mixing in aesthetically California settings
- Beach parking lots at sunset. Rooftops with palm trees. Car with ocean view.
- Distinctive visual + consistent format = recognition over time
- End card: "What should I mix next? Comment below."

**Why it works:**
- Leverages his "coastal energy" positioning
- Creates visual distinction in a sea of bedroom DJ clips
- Repeatable without getting stale (infinite California locations)
- Encourages engagement through requests

### The Mashup Factory

DJ Lilli went from 0 → 100K in two weeks with mashups. Billy Gillies' mashup "DNA (Loving You)" got 120M+ streams.

**Andrew's Mashup Strategy:**
1. **Mine trending sounds** — What's viral on TikTok right now?
2. **Add bass house twist** — His signature sound applied to trending audio
3. **Release 2-3 mashups per week** — Volume creates opportunity for virality
4. **Use hashtag strategy** — #mashup, #remix, #[originalsongname], #basshouse

**Key insight:** Mashups have higher viral potential than original tracks because they tap into existing audiences for both songs.

### The Origin Story Sprint

Andrew's Navy-to-producer story is powerful and underutilized. This is "Underdog" positioning that builds emotional connection.

**Content series: "From Pearl Harbor to LA"**
- Episode 1: "I saw DJ Craze at Love Festival and my life changed"
- Episode 2: "I practiced DJing in Navy barracks in Florida"
- Episode 3: "I left a $100K job to move to LA with nothing"
- Episode 4: "The pandemic took everything — here's how I survived"
- Episode 5: "How meeting AC Slater changed my trajectory"

**Format:** 60-90 second talking head clips, authentic storytelling, minimal production.

**Why it works:**
- People follow people, not just music
- Differentiates him from thousands of "LA producer" stories
- Gives fans a reason to root for him
- Creates shareable, emotional content that algorithms favor

---

## Phase 2: Viral Bets

### The Trend-Jacking Protocol

When something goes viral, Andrew should be remixing it within 24-48 hours.

**Process:**
1. Monitor trending sounds on TikTok daily
2. Identify tracks that could get a bass house treatment
3. Create 60-second bass house edit
4. Post with relevant hashtags + tag original artist
5. Cross-post everywhere

**Target:** At least one trend-jacked remix per week.

**Example hits to study:**
- Billy Gillies' "DNA (Loving You)" — Etta James sample → UK Top 10
- FISHER's "Losing It" — Simple hook, massive viral moment
- John Summit's "Deep End" — Beatport #1, TikTok fuel

### The Collaboration Cascade

Andrew already has support from A-listers. Time to leverage it.

**Strategy:**
1. Create unofficial remixes of tracks by artists who've supported him
2. Tag them in posts
3. Hope for repost/engagement that exposes to their audience

**Targets:**
- Any track from someone who's already played his music
- Rising bass house artists slightly ahead of him (collab potential)
- Vocalists who want bass house exposure (adds singability to his catalog)

### The Bootleg Bomb

Unofficial remixes that are too good to ignore.

**Process:**
1. Take a mainstream pop hit that's currently viral
2. Create a bass house bootleg
3. Release on SoundCloud (where bootlegs live safely)
4. Tease on TikTok/IG with the drop
5. Drive traffic to SoundCloud

**Why it works:** Bootlegs tap into existing fanbases of major artists. If the bootleg is fire, it gets shared by fans of both artists.

---

## Phase 3: Conversion Architecture

### Discord Community: "The Lux Lounge"

Build the superfan infrastructure now, before he "needs" it.

**Structure:**
- #announcements — releases, shows, news
- #new-music — track reactions, upcoming releases
- #studio-sessions — production clips, works in progress
- #show-recaps — photos, videos from performances
- #requests — what mashups/remixes fans want
- #vibes — general chat, memes, community

**Growth tactics:**
- Exclusive early access to unreleased tracks
- Monthly "listening party" for new releases
- Direct interaction (Andrew responding personally)
- Fan remix contests with prizes

### Email List: The Owned Channel

Social media can change algorithms. Email is owned.

**Capture points:**
- Link in bio → simple landing page
- "Free mashup pack" as lead magnet
- QR code at live shows
- Discord integration

**Use for:**
- Show announcements
- Release drops
- Exclusive content
- Direct monetization (merch, VIP experiences)

### Streaming Conversion

Goal: Turn TikTok views into Spotify streams.

**Tactics:**
1. **End every viral clip with:** "Full track in bio"
2. **Pre-save campaigns** for new releases
3. **Create "focus" playlists** featuring his tracks + similar artists
4. **Release consistently** — algorithm rewards regular drops

## The EDC Pathway

### Current Position
- Already has IN/ROTATION releases (Insomniac ecosystem)

- Has industry validation but not metrics

### Required Benchmarks

## The Bottom Line

Andrew Lux has already done the hard part: making music good enough to get signed to Night Bass and IN/ROTATION, and getting support from Skrillex and Fred Again.

Now he needs to do the unsexy part: showing up every single day with content that builds audience.

The formula is clear:
- **Velocity:** 8-12 pieces of content per week
- **Signature format:** "Coastal Cuts" becomes his thing
- **Viral bets:** Mashups and bootlegs that can break through
- **Origin story:** The Navy-to-LA journey creates emotional connection
- **Community:** Discord + email = owned audience

**If Andrew executes this for 12-18 months consistently, the metrics will follow. And when the metrics follow, the EDC booking becomes a matter of when, not if.**

He's already proven he can make it in the industry. Now he needs to prove he can make it in the algorithm.
