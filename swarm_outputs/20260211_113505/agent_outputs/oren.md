**SUMMARY**
This alignment shifts the brand from a "maintenance/renovation" aesthetic (The Rebuild) to a "mythic/technological" aesthetic (The Resurrection). By applying the CEV Framework (Composition, Effectivity, Vibes), we move the messaging away from the "crisis" quadrant into the "premium reactivation" quadrant, ensuring the language resonates with high-performers who view themselves as dormant titans rather than broken projects.

**KEY FINDINGS**
- **The Semantics of Status**: "Resurrection" is a high-variance term. Without strict taste-guardrails, it defaults to "crisis/religious." When anchored in "Dormant Power Reactivation," it becomes a proprietary "moat" that competitors using generic optimization language cannot replicate.
- **Vibe Calibration**: The current prompt’s rejection of "Resurrection" was a failure of creative direction. "Optimization" alone is a commodity; "Resurrection as Optimization" is a category-of-one brand.
- **Compositional Shift**: Transitioning from "The Rebuild" to "The Resurrection" requires moving from *scaffolding* metaphors to *awakening/ignition* metaphors.

### TASK 1: GEMINI SYSTEM PROMPT REWRITE

**REVISED LINE 76:**
"His messaging must be OPTIMIZATION-focused, not CRISIS-focused. Position 'The Resurrection' as the ultimate premium vehicle for high-level optimization—the reactivation of the apex version of the self that the empire-building process forced into dormancy."

**REVISED LINES 80-82:**
"Resurrection = Dormant Power Reactivation. It is a mythic, memorable, and premium reclamation of the user's 'Buried Edge.' It is not a response to a breakdown; it is the scheduled upgrade to a superior operating system."

**REVISED LINE 160:**
"Check for crisis language: Ensure 'Resurrection' is never used to imply the client is 'dead' or 'broken.' It must always signal the 'Reactivation' of a powerful, existing internal asset."

**REVISED LINES 245-253 (The 'Taste' Guardrails):**
*   **BAD (Low Taste/Shame-based):** "You’re a coward with a smile, dying slowly in your suit."
*   **GOOD (High Taste/Resurrection-aligned):** "You have built the empire, but the engine that built it has gone dormant. You are operating on a legacy system while your true hardware—the version of you that takes what it wants—waits for reactivation."

**LANGUAGE GUIDE (DO/DON'T):**
*   **DO:** Dormant, buried edge, reclaim, reactivate, system restoration, hardware-first, operating system reset, apex-state, dormant power, dormant titan.
*   **DON'T:** Coward, dying slowly, broken, rock bottom, crisis, intervention, saving, fixing, "the rebuild," help, struggle.

*   **Update 2:** Replace "Competitive Advantage: Superior Rebuild Speed" with **"Competitive Advantage: Proprietary Dormant Power Reactivation (The Resurrection)."**

### TASK 3: INTERNAL DOCS

**Option 3 Summary Replacement:**
"A high-ticket transformation focused on **The Resurrection** of the executive's dormant physical and mental edge. This is not a fix; it is a reactivation of the power that built their success."

**Revision Summary Report Replacement:**
"Shifted all brand touchpoints from 'The Rebuild' to **'The Resurrection.'** Realigned the semantic architecture to prioritize 'Dormant Power Reactivation' over 'Crisis Management' to better serve the $250k+ executive demographic."

**Option A2 Doc Replacement:**
"The Resurrection Protocol: A hardware-first approach to reclaiming the apex version of the executive. Moving beyond the 'Rebuild' phase into a total system reactivation."

**CONFIDENCE**: High

**DISSENT**
The term "Resurrection" carries a heavy mythic weight. My only reservation is that if the coach’s visual branding (website, photography) remains "fitness-generic," the word "Resurrection" will feel hyperbolic. The *Vibe* must be matched by high-production-value creative—think "Dark Knight Rises" or "High-End Tech Unboxing," not "Local CrossFit Gym." The taste must be expensive to support the word.
