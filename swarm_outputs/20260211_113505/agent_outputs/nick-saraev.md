**SUMMARY**
The pivot from "The Rebuild" to "The Resurrection" requires more than a find-and-replace; it requires a logic-gate update to the agent's core DO (Define-Orchestrate) framework. By reclassifying "Resurrection" from a crisis-coded event to a "Dormant Power Reactivation" system, we move the AI from a remedial coach to a premium systems-optimizer for high-leverage executives.

**KEY FINDINGS**
*   **Semantic Drift Risk:** LLMs naturally associate "Resurrection" with crisis, religion, or death. Without a "Self-Annealing" validation loop, the agent will default to "saving" language which alienates $250k+ earners.
*   **Hardware vs. Software Metaphor:** The target demographic responds to "Hardware/OS" metaphors (system restoration) rather than "Psychological/Emotional" metaphors (healing/brokenness).
*   **The "Coward" Trap:** Using aggressive "coward" language (Line 245) creates a low-status resonance. High-status individuals respond to the "Dormant Edge" narrative—acknowledging their success while highlighting their current lack of "System Optimization."

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

### TASK 1: GEMINI SYSTEM PROMPT REWRITE (PRODUCTION-READY)

**REWRITE: LINE 76**
> "Messaging must be strictly OPTIMIZATION-focused. Resurrection is the premium brand for optimization; it represents the reactivation of the elite systems that built the empire but have since gone dormant."

**REWRITE: LINE 80-82**
> "DEFINITION: Resurrection = Dormant Power Reactivation. It is mythic, memorable, and premium. It is NOT a response to crisis; it is the reclamation of a buried edge. The executive is not broken; his primary power systems are simply offline."

**REWRITE: LINE 160 (Self-Correction/Validation Block)**
> "VALIDATION LOOP: Before outputting, check for 'Crisis-Coding.' If the text implies the client is 'broken,' 'failing,' or 'in need of saving,' trigger a self-correction. Pivot language to 'System Restoration,' 'Hardware-First Reactivation,' or 'Operating System Reset.'"

**REWRITE: LINES 245-253 (The Status Alignment)**
> *   **BAD (Crisis-Coded):** "You’re a coward with a smile, dying slowly while your empire grows."
> *   **GOOD (Resurrection-Aligned):** "You are an empire-builder who has allowed his edge to go dormant. You have the hardware for greatness, but your current operating system is throttling your power. It is time to reactivate the buried edge that got you here."

**BRAND LANGUAGE GUARDRAILS (The DO/DONT Framework)**
*   **DO:** Dormant, buried edge, reclaim, reactivate, system restoration, hardware-first, operating system reset, dormant power, reactivation.
*   **DONT:** Coward, dying slowly, broken, rock bottom, crisis, intervention, saving, fixing, weak.

### TASK 2: COMPETITIVE INTELLIGENCE REPLACEMENT
*   **Ref 1:** "Unlike 'The Resurrection' [formerly The Rebuild], which focuses on hardware-first reactivation, competitor X focuses on emotional processing."
*   **Ref 2:** "The Resurrection methodology identifies dormant power centers that traditional executive coaching ignores."

---

### TASK 3: INTERNAL DOCS UPDATE
*   **Option 3 Summary:** "A high-ticket transition for the executive who feels dormant. The Resurrection framework replaces remedial 'rebuilding' with elite power reactivation."
*   **Revision Summary Report:** "Shifted all brand assets from 'The Rebuild' to 'The Resurrection.' Updated AI logic to ensure Resurrection is coded as premium optimization, not crisis management."
*   **Option A2 Doc:** "The Resurrection protocol: A 12-week operating system reset for the 250K+ male executive. Focus: Reactivating the dormant edge."

**CONFIDENCE**: High. These changes align the agentic workflow with high-status positioning and prevent the "remedial drift" common in AI-generated coaching content.

**DISSENT**
The term "Resurrection" is inherently "heavy." There is a slight risk that search algorithms or AI safety filters may flag "Resurrection" as religious content. To mitigate this, the prompt must explicitly instruct the agent to use **Industrial/Systems metaphors** (Hardware, OS, Reactivation) to anchor the word in a secular, high-performance context. If the agent drifts into "spiritual" language, the brand's "optimization" authority will be compromised.
