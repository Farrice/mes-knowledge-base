**SUMMARY**
Virality is a byproduct of clarity, not "hype." To write a hook for AI consulting, we must move from abstract claims (e.g., "unlocking efficiency") to concrete evidence (e.g., "saving 14 hours on X task"). The goal is to make the reader *visualize* the friction being removed.

**KEY FINDINGS**
- **The "Ghost Word" Trap:** Most AI hooks fail because they use non-falsifiable words like "transform," "optimize," or "leverage." If a competitor can say the same thing without changing a word, the copy is dead.
- **Visualization is Authority:** People don't buy "AI consulting"; they buy the deletion of a specific, painful manual process. You must "Zoom-In" until the reader can see the spreadsheet or the Slack message you are replacing.
- **The One Mississippi Test:** If the reader doesn't understand the specific value proposition in the time it takes to say "One Mississippi," they will keep scrolling. Complexity is the enemy of virality.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
- **The Hook:** "Your operations team spends 12 hours a week manually mapping CSVs. We built a custom agent that does it in 4 seconds for $0.08. Here is the exact architecture we used to kill the grunt work."
- **Apply the Zoom-In Technique:** Don't say "AI for Marketing." Say "An AI agent that drafts 50 personalized LinkedIn outreach messages based on a lead's latest 3 podcast appearances."
- **Use Falsifiable Proof:** Replace "highly effective" with "98% accuracy" or "implemented in 48 hours." If you can’t point to a specific result, don’t claim a general benefit.

**CONFIDENCE**: High

**DISSENT**
"Viral hooks" often lean into "The Dirty Tap"—writing a lot of low-quality, high-engagement bait. My contrarian view is that **boring specificity** beats **exciting vagueness** for high-ticket consulting. A hook that gets 100 views from COOs is more valuable than one that gets 100,000 views from "AI enthusiasts." Don't optimize for the algorithm; optimize for the person with the budget to hire you.
