# Swarm Synthesis: Write 1 viral hook for an AI consulting service

## Executive Summary
The synthesis identifies a critical shift from "AI hype" to "operational specificity." To achieve virality that converts into high-ticket consulting, the hook must avoid "ghost words" (e.g., *optimize, transform*) and instead focus on the "Zoom-In" technique—targeting a specific, painful manual task. The recommended strategy prioritizes "boring specificity" to attract decision-makers (COOs/VPs) over generic engagement-bait for enthusiasts.

## Unanimous Agreements
| Finding | Supporting Agents |
|---------|------------------|
| **Specificity > Hype:** Concrete evidence (time/cost saved) outperforms abstract claims. | harry-dry |
| **The "One Mississippi" Test:** Value must be understood instantly; complexity kills conversion. | harry-dry |
| **Falsifiable Proof:** Claims must be backed by specific, measurable data (e.g., "$0.08 per task") to build authority. | harry-dry |
| **Avoid "Ghost Words":** Words like "leverage" or "transform" are non-falsifiable and weaken the hook. | harry-dry |

## Key Recommendations
| Recommendation | Confidence | Lead Agent |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| **The Winning Hook:** "Your operations team spends 12 hours a week manually mapping CSVs. We built a custom agent that does it in 4 seconds for $0.08. Here is the exact architecture we used to kill the grunt work." | High | harry-dry |
| **Apply the "Zoom-In" Technique:** Replace broad categories (e.g., "AI for Marketing") with granular tasks (e.g., "AI that drafts 50 personalized LinkedIn messages from podcast appearances"). | High | harry-dry |
| **Target the Budget, Not the Algorithm:** Optimize for the 100 people who can hire you rather than the 100,000 who will just "like" the post. | High | harry-dry |

## Conflicts & Minority Report
**Conflict: Engagement vs. Conversion**
While the objective asks for a "viral" hook, the expert (harry-dry) argues that traditional virality is a "Dirty Tap"—high-volume, low-quality traffic. 
*   **Minority View:** "Boring specificity" is the superior path for consulting. A hook that seems "boring" to the general public is actually "magnetic" to the specific executive dealing with that exact pain point.
*   **Condition:** If the goal is brand awareness/newsletter growth, lean into broader AI trends. If the goal is immediate consulting leads, use the specific CSV/Operations hook provided.

## Next Steps
1. **Identify the "Friction Point":** Choose the single most tedious manual task your service automates (e.g., data entry, lead research, reporting).
2. **Quantify the Replacement:** Calculate the exact time and cost difference between the human process and the AI agent.
3. **Deploy the Architecture:** Post the hook followed by a visual or technical breakdown of the "how" to establish immediate technical authority.
