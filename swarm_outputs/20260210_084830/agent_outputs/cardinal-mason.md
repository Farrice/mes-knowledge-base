**SUMMARY**
My analysis reveals that viral hooks for AI consulting targeting coaches and consultants must aggressively agitate their core pains (time scarcity, client acquisition, tech overwhelm) and immediately promise specific, tangible benefits using AI as the lever. These hooks leverage specificity and a "secret weapon" framing to drive engagement.

**KEY FINDINGS**
-   **Pains Drive Urgency**: Coaches and consultants are overwhelmed, often trading time for money, and fear being left behind by AI-savvy competitors. Hooks must first tap into this anxiety or a strong desire for a shortcut.
-   **Specificity Sells the "How"**: Generic claims about "using AI" fall flat. Viral hooks require concrete numbers, specific outcomes, or a clear, simplified system to make the solution feel real and achievable.
-   **Benefit-Centric Transformation**: The focus must be on the *outcome* AI delivers (e.g., more clients, more revenue, less work, increased authority), not merely the technology itself. The "AI" is the vehicle, the transformation is the destination.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
Here are 3 viral hooks designed with these principles:

1.  **Hook (Time & Scale Focus):** "Stop trading hours for dollars. How coaches are using AI to clone their best work, deliver 10x value, and scale to 7-figures *without* burnout or hiring a massive team."
    *   *Why it works*: Agitates the common "time-for-money" pain, offers a powerful benefit ("clone best work," "10x value," "7-figures"), and addresses a major fear (burnout/hiring) with AI as the solution. Specificity in "10x" and "7-figures."

2.  **Hook (Client Acquisition & Competitive Edge Focus):** "Your competition is already using AI to ethically steal your leads. Here's the 3-step system coaches are deploying to automate client acquisition, personalize outreach, and dominate their niche in just 90 days."
    *   *Why it works*: Creates immediate urgency and a sense of threat ("competition is stealing your leads"), then offers an "ethical" counter-strategy. Provides a clear, actionable system ("3-step system") and specific benefits ("automate client acquisition," "personalize outreach," "dominate niche") with a timeframe ("90 days").

3.  **Hook (Revenue & Authority with Ease Focus):** "The 'Lazy Coach' AI Blueprint: How my clients are generating an extra $15K-$30K/month using simple AI tools, becoming instant authorities, and working 5 hours less a week – even if they're not 'techy'."
    *   *Why it works*: Intriguing "Lazy Coach" angle hints at ease. Offers highly specific financial benefits ("$15K-$30K/month") and lifestyle benefits ("working 5 hours less"). Directly addresses the tech fear ("even if they're not 'techy'") and promises authority, making AI accessible and powerfully beneficial.

**CONFIDENCE**: High

**DISSENT**:
While these hooks are designed for high engagement and virality, the term "viral" also heavily relies on distribution strategy and platform algorithms. The "Lazy Coach" hook, while highly effective for relatability and ease, might slightly deter a small segment of very high-end, traditional consultants who prefer a more formal tone. However, for the broader coach/consultant market, its appeal to efficiency without effort is usually a powerful driver.
