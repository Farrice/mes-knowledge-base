**SUMMARY**
The proposed hooks effectively leverage core professional anxieties and aspirations of coaches and consultants, grounding them in specific, falsifiable claims. They pass the Three Rules Test by offering clear visualizations, verifiable promises, and unique angles that differentiate them from generic AI pitches.

**KEY FINDINGS**
*   **Pain Point Precision:** Each hook directly addresses a critical pain point for coaches and consultants: income ceilings, competitive disadvantage, or the fear of professional obsolescence, making them highly resonant.
*   **Falsifiable Specificity:** Abstract benefits are replaced with concrete, verifiable outcomes like "scale without hiring" or "deliver deeper, faster results," enhancing credibility and memorability.
*   **Conflict as Momentum:** The hooks inject tension by framing the problem as a direct threat (competitors, limits) or an urgent opportunity, compelling immediate attention and action.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
1.  **Integrate Visual-Verbal Synthesis:** Develop accompanying visuals (e.g., a graph showing capped income vs. exponential growth, a split screen of a coach overwhelmed vs. focused, a competitor's logo being digitally built) *simultaneously* with these hooks. The words are only half the battle; their context is everything.
2.  **Quantify "Deeper, Faster Results":** For the third hook, prepare to immediately follow up with concrete examples or metrics (e.g., "reduce client prep time by 30%," "increase client retention by 15% through AI-powered insights") to solidify the "deeper, faster" claim.
3.  **Pre-Test for One Mississippi Comprehension:** Before broader deployment, conduct quick user tests with target coaches/consultants. If any hook requires more than a second or two to grasp its core message, refine it for even greater clarity and punch.

**CONFIDENCE**: High

**DISSENT**:
Some might argue that "viral" hooks demand more emotional hyperbole or a "shock factor" beyond what's presented. My perspective, however, is that for a B2B audience like coaches and consultants, clarity, direct value, and addressing immediate professional threats and opportunities generate more sustainable "virality" (i.e., sharing due to genuine relevance) than abstract or overly sensationalized claims. The strength here lies in the precision of the problem identification and the specific, actionable solution implied, rather than generic cleverness.
