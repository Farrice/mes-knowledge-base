# Swarm Synthesis: Write 1 viral hook for an AI consulting service

## Executive Summary
The recommended viral hook for an AI consulting service is: "Most businesses *burn* 80% of their AI budget on speculation. We pinpoint the 20% that delivers provable ROI in 90 days." This hook is designed to create immediate conflict by identifying a widespread, painful problem with a specific, falsifiable claim. It then offers a concrete, time-bound solution focused on provable ROI, aiming to differentiate the service and attract clients actively seeking to avoid wasted AI investments.

| The hook should leverage specific, falsifiable claims to create conflict and cut through noise. | harry-dry |
| Specificity (e.g., "20%," "90 days," "provable ROI") is crucial for making abstract concepts concrete and verifiable. | harry-dry |
| Visual language ("burn," "pinpoint") enhances memorability and impact. | harry-dry |

## Key Recommendations
| Recommendation | Confidence | Lead Agent |
|----------------|------------|------------|
| **Core Viral Hook:** "Most businesses *burn* 80% of their AI budget on speculation. We pinpoint the 20% that delivers provable ROI in 90 days." | High | harry-dry |
| **Validate the 80% Claim:** Prepare to immediately back up the "80% burn" claim with industry data, case studies, or a diagnostic tool. | High | harry-dry |
| **Ensure Visual-Verbal Synthesis:** Align any visual creative (e.g., ad, landing page) to reinforce the hook's message of wasted investment versus focused, profitable AI. | High | harry-dry |
| **Apply Kaplan's Law Review:** Ruthlessly ensure every word in the hook is working hard, choosing impactful terms like "burn" over "waste" or "speculation" over "hype." | High | harry-dry |

## Conflicts & Minority Report
**Potential for Alienation vs. Strategic Conflict Generation:**
A minority position (anticipated by harry-dry) suggests that the "80% burn" figure might be too aggressive, potentially alienating potential clients who feel they are part of that statistic. However, the dominant perspective argues that this calculated aggression creates necessary conflict, attracting those who are already feeling the pain of wasted AI investment and are serious about finding effective solutions. It forces a decision and separates results-driven clients from those comfortable with vague promises, thereby leading to higher engagement with the *right* audience.

## Next Steps
1.  **Evidence Gathering:** Compile existing industry reports, internal case studies, or begin developing a proprietary diagnostic tool to substantiate the "80% burn" claim.
2.  **Creative Concepting:** Develop visual concepts for marketing materials (e.g., ad creatives, landing page hero sections) that visually represent the "burning budget" and "pinpointing ROI" concepts.
3.  **Internal Readiness Check:** Ensure the consulting service's methodology and messaging are fully aligned with the promise of "pinpointing the 20% that delivers provable ROI in 90 days."
