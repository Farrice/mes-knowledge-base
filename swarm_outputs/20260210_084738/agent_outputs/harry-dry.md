**SUMMARY**
The proposed hook leverages a specific, falsifiable claim about widespread AI project waste, immediately creating conflict and positioning your service as the precise solution. It passes the Three Rules Test by being highly visual, verifiable, and difficult for a generic competitor to sign without substantial backing.

**KEY FINDINGS**

*   **Conflict & Falsifiability:** The hook "Most businesses *burn* 80% of their AI budget on speculation" instantly introduces a painful, common problem, creating tension. "Burn" is highly visual. The 80% figure, while potentially an estimate, is a specific, falsifiable claim that invites scrutiny and positions your service as the antidote. This is far stronger than vague promises.
*   **Zoom-In & Specificity:** Instead of "AI solutions," the hook zooms into "pinpoint the 20% that delivers provable ROI in 90 days." This transforms an abstract concept into concrete actions and outcomes. "Pinpoint" is visual. "Provable ROI" is a direct challenge to the "speculation" and is highly falsifiable. The "90 days" provides a critical, tangible timeframe.
*   **Uniqueness & Competitor Test:** While others might promise ROI, the specific framing of "80% burned on speculation" combined with the "pinpoint 20%" and "90 days" makes this hook difficult for a generic competitor to sign without a truly differentiated methodology. It implies a unique, efficient process for identifying high-impact AI initiatives.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

1.  **Validate the 80%:** Immediately prepare to back up the "80% burn" claim with industry data, case studies, or even a diagnostic tool. Harry Dry's philosophy is "Don't Talk, Only Point"—if you claim it, you must be ready to point to the evidence.
2.  **Visual-Verbal Synthesis:** When deploying this hook, ensure the visual context (e.g., ad creative, landing page hero section) reinforces the message. Perhaps a graphic depicting a large, burning pile of money with a small, focused beam of light hitting a productive machine. The words and design must act as one.
3.  **Kaplan's Law Review:** This hook is already dense, but always ask: "Is every single word working?" "Burn" is better than "waste." "Speculation" is better than "hype." "Provable" is better than "measurable." Maintain this ruthless efficiency.

**CONFIDENCE**: High

**DISSENT**:
Some might argue that the "80% burn" figure is too aggressive or might alienate potential clients who feel they are part of that 80%. However, from a Harry Dry perspective, this creates necessary conflict and separates those serious about results from those comfortable with vague promises. It forces a decision and attracts those who are *already* feeling the pain of wasted AI investment. It's a calculated risk for higher engagement with the right audience.
