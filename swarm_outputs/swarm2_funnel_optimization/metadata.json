  "objective": "Optimize the sales funnel and offer positioning for Acusio Bivona, The Resurrection Coach. He has two offers: The Rebuild ($10K, 90-day body-led OS reset for executives) and The Intensive ($4,997, 30-day proof-of-concept). His ICP is male executives, 35-55, $150K+ income, who are succeeding externally but feel empty/numb. 4 archetypes: Hollow Emperor (has everything, feels nothing), Exhausted Operator (running on fumes, body breaking), Fading Titan (losing edge, knows it), Isolated Builder (built empire, lost connection). Core metaphor: 'buried alive' \u2014 success is the coffin, the body is the first shovel. He is NOT a therapist \u2014 he's a body-first executive optimizer. His funnel: LinkedIn content \u2192 System Failure Assessment quiz (8 diagnostic questions that auto-score into Red/Yellow/Green zones) \u2192 5-email cold lead nurture sequence (7-10 days) \u2192 Strategy Call booking page (8-question qualifier) \u2192 90-minute Strategy Call \u2192 close to Rebuild or Intensive. DELIVERABLES: (1) Optimize the 5-email nurture sequence \u2014 make each email tighter, more diagnostic, with stronger conviction-building toward the call. (2) Sharpen offer page copy for both The Rebuild ($10K) and The Intensive ($4,997) \u2014 the $10K should feel like a CapEx investment, the $4,997 should feel like a no-brainer proof-of-concept. (3) Improve the booking page and CTA progression across the funnel. (4) Strategic recommendations for increasing conversion at each stage. CONSTRAINTS: Zero crisis/drowning language. Optimization framing only. Diagnostic tone \u2014 like a specialist, not a guru. No hype, no urgency tricks. Premium positioning throughout. The executive should feel like they're being assessed by a peer-level specialist, not pitched by a salesperson.",
