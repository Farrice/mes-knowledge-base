  "objective": "Rewrite and elevate LinkedIn content for Acusio Bivona, The Resurrection Coach. He sells a $10K 90-day body-led OS reset for male executives (35-55, $150K+) who are succeeding externally but feel empty/numb. His 4 archetypes are: Hollow Emperor (has everything, feels nothing), Exhausted Operator (running on fumes, body breaking), Fading Titan (losing edge, knows it), Isolated Builder (built empire, lost connection). Core metaphor: 'buried alive' \u2014 success is the coffin, the body is the first shovel. He is NOT a therapist or crisis coach \u2014 he's a body-first executive optimizer. His method: starts with the body (sleep, nervous system, movement) BEFORE mindset or strategy. Bridge offer: The Intensive ($4,997, 30-day proof-of-concept). Content must feel premium, diagnostic, and direct \u2014 never preachy or motivational. Every post needs a scroll-stopping hook, one clear insight, and a soft CTA that moves toward a strategy call or the System Failure Assessment quiz. Target: LinkedIn content that a $300K COO would screenshot and send to his partner saying 'this is what I've been trying to explain.' DELIVERABLES: (1) Rewrite 10 LinkedIn posts \u2014 copy-paste ready, premium quality, each targeting a different archetype or pain point. (2) Create 20 scroll-stopping hooks \u2014 opening lines that stop a busy executive mid-scroll. (3) A content framework Acusio can use to keep creating at this level. AVOID: motivational speaker tone, crisis/drowning language, therapy framing, generic coaching platitudes, anything a Tony Robbins clone would say. USE: diagnostic language, body-first science, optimization framing, quiet authority, specificity over hype.",
