**SUMMARY**
The transition from 'The Rebuild' to 'The Resurrection' shifts the psychological positioning from *remedial* (fixing what is broken) to *aspirational* (awakening what is elite). By framing the offer around 'Dormant Power Reactivation,' we align with the executive ego, moving the sales conversation from a "repair shop" dynamic to a "throne room" reclamation.

**KEY FINDINGS**
*   **Status Alignment:** Executives resist "rebuilding" because it implies structural failure; they embrace "resurrection" because it implies a temporary hibernation of a power they already possess.
*   **The Trust Gradient:** The $4,997 Intensive acts as a "Psychological Bridge," allowing the client to experience the 'spark' of reactivation before committing to the full $10,000 'inferno' of the Resurrection.
*   **Risk Reversal:** By using "Dormant Power" language, the risk is no longer the coach’s ability to deliver, but the executive’s continued suppression of their own latent potential.

### **REPLACEMENT COPY: SALES & OFFER DOCUMENTS**

#### **OFFER 1: The Intensive ($4,997 Bridge Offer)**
*   **The Hook:** "You are intrigued by **The Resurrection**."
*   **The Structure:** "This is Phase 1 of **The Resurrection**—the initial spark that identifies exactly where your power went dormant."
*   **The Ascension:** "At any point during the Intensive, you can upgrade to the full 90-day **Resurrection** experience."
*   **The Choice:** "Option 1: Upgrade to **The Resurrection**."
*   **The Anchor:** "**The Resurrection: 10,000**."
*   **FAQ (Dormant Power Reframing):** 
    *   *Q: Why not just start with The Resurrection?* 
    *   *A: You can. But for many, power has been dormant for so long that a direct reactivation is too jarring. The Intensive serves as the 'Grid Test'—we map your dormant assets and clear the line interference first. If you’re ready to reclaim the empire today, we start with the full Resurrection. If you need to see the lights flicker on first, we start with the Intensive.*
*   **The Math:** "The Intensive ($4,997) plus the full Resurrection engagement ($10,000) brings the total investment to **$14,997**." *(Note: If providing a bundle credit, adjust to $12,497 as per original ratio).*

#### **OFFER 2: The Core Offer ($10,000)**
*   **The Promise:** "What **The Resurrection** delivers is not a new you, but the *real* you—the one who built the empire before the noise of the empire silenced him."
*   **The Call to Action:** "If you are ready to stop managing your decline and start leading your awakening, it’s time to move forward with **The Resurrection**."
*   **The Closing (Dormant Power Frame):** "This isn't a repair job. This is **The Resurrection**. We aren't building a new man; we are reactivating the dormant titan who has been waiting under the surface of your success. Let’s bring him back online."

#### **BOOKING PAGE (8 Questions)**
1.  "Are you ready to move forward with **The Resurrection** (10K, 90 days) to reclaim your peak state?"
2.  "**The Resurrection** may not be the right fit if you are seeking a 'maintenance' coach; this is for those who demand a total reactivation of their dormant power."
3.  "**The Resurrection** requires a full commitment to the man you were before you started settling. Are you prepared for that level of honesty?"
4.  "What is the specific 'Empire Goal' you are currently **reactivating toward**?"
5.  "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is it for you to **talk about The Resurrection** and end the dormancy period?"
*   **Auto-Reply Rejection (Resurrection Frame):** "Based on your application, you aren't ready for **The Resurrection** yet. Resurrection requires a hunger to awaken that we aren't seeing in your answers. Your power is still too comfortable being dormant. We wish you the best in your current phase."

#### **PHASE 3 LEAD GEN (6 DM Scripts)**
1.  "I saw your post about the new project. It sounds like you're building fast, but is the 'Original Architect' still in the room, or has he gone dormant? We should **map the resurrection** of that version of you."
2.  "Most guys at your level are just 'rebuilding' their old habits. I’m looking for someone ready to **map the resurrection** of their dormant power. Interested?"
3.  "You’ve built the empire, but have you lost the king? Let’s jump on a quick call to **map the resurrection** of your peak executive state."
4.  "I have a framework to **map the resurrection** of dormant power in 90 days. It’s for the 10K/month executive who feels like they’re running on 40% battery. Want the details?"
5.  "Stop trying to 'fix' what isn't broken. You're just dormant. Let’s **map the resurrection** of your primary drive before the end of the quarter."
6.  "If we were to **map the resurrection** of your most powerful self today, what’s the first thing that comes back online?"

**RECOMMENDATIONS**
*   **Recommendation 1 (Offer Pyramid):** Use the $4,997 Intensive as a "Diagnostic Sprint." It should feel like a high-speed audit that *reveals* how much power is actually dormant, making the $10K Resurrection feel like a necessity rather than an option.
*   **Recommendation 2 (Sales Psychology):** In sales calls, never use the word "problem." Use the word "latency." You aren't fixing a problem; you are reducing the latency between his dormant power and his current results.
*   **Recommendation 3 (Price Anchoring):** Always present the $10,000 Resurrection first. When you "downsell" to the $4,997 Intensive, frame it as the "Ignition Sequence" for those who want to verify the power grid before the full reactivation.

**CONFIDENCE**: High

**DISSENT**: 
The term "Resurrection" carries significant weight. While it works perfectly for the "Dormant Power" reframe, ensure the visual branding (colors/typography) is aggressive and modern (e.g., slate, gold, obsidian) rather than "spiritual" or "soft." If the branding looks too "New Age," the $10K executive will perceive it as "woo-woo" rather than a high-performance reactivation.
