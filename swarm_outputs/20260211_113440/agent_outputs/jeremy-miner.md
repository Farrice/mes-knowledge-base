**SUMMARY**
The shift from "The Rebuild" to "The Resurrection" is a profound identity upgrade. "Rebuild" implies the prospect is broken or has failed; "Resurrection" (framed as Dormant Power Reactivation) implies the prospect is a sleeping giant whose previous empire-building success is the very proof of their future potential.

**KEY FINDINGS**
- **Identity Conflict:** High-level executives resist the "Rebuild" frame because it suggests they are starting over from zero, which wounds the ego. "Resurrection" honors their past achievements while identifying their current state as "dormant," not "dead."
- **Framing the Gap:** The $10,000 price point is justified not by the labor of the coach, but by the ROI of the "Dormant Power" being reactivated. We are selling the *reclamation* of a high-value identity.
- **Resistance Dissolution:** By using "Resurrection" language, we move from a "Problem/Solution" sale (low ticket) to an "Identity/Potential" sale (high ticket).

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

### OFFER 1: THE INTENSIVE ($4,997 BRIDGE)
*   **Initial Interest:** "You’ve seen the potential of what **The Resurrection** can do for your current trajectory."
*   **Phase 1:** "This Intensive serves as the initial spark—Phase 1 of **The Resurrection**—where we identify the specific power centers that have gone quiet."
*   **The Upgrade Path:** "Once the spark is lit, most move to fully operationalize that power by transitioning into the full 90-day **Resurrection**."
*   **The Math:** "The Intensive ($4,997) plus the full **Resurrection** ($10,000) represents a total commitment of $14,997 to your reactivation, though starting with the Intensive gives you the immediate 'bridge' to that higher state."
*   **FAQ (Why not start with the full offer?):** "You could. Most executives who know their dormant power is costing them five or six figures a month in lost momentum choose to bypass the bridge and go straight to **The Resurrection**. It’s simply a matter of how fast you want that version of yourself back at the helm."

### OFFER 2: THE CORE OFFER ($10,000)
*   **Value Delivery:** "What **The Resurrection** delivers isn't a new set of skills; it's the systematic reactivation of the executive presence and 'dormant power' that built your empire in the first place."
*   **The Close:** "This isn't about fixing what's broken. This is **The Resurrection** of the version of you that doesn't know how to lose."

### THE BOOKING PAGE (8 QUESTIONS)
*   **Commitment Frame:** "Are you prepared to fully commit to **The Resurrection**, or are you still looking for a temporary 'rebuild'?"
*   **Fit Frame:** "**The Resurrection** is a high-intensity reactivation; if you aren't ready to handle the weight of your own dormant power, this may not be the right fit for you right now."
*   **Objective Frame:** "Instead of just 'rebuilding' what was, what specific 'dormant powers' are we looking to reactivate during **The Resurrection**?"
*   **Rejection Message (Auto-reply):** "Based on your answers, it seems you’re looking for a traditional 'rebuild' or a fix. **The Resurrection** is specifically for those who already have the empire and simply need to reactivate the dormant power that built it. We don't feel we're the right match to help you at this stage."

### PHASE 3: LEAD GEN (DM SCRIPTS)
*   **Script Logic:** "I’m curious, [Name], have you ever felt like the version of you that built all this success has just... gone dormant? We're helping a few people **map out a Resurrection** of that specific power this month. Would you be against seeing what that map looks like for your current role?"

**CONFIDENCE**: High

**DISSENT**
The term "Resurrection" carries heavy religious baggage for some. To avoid "The Savior Complex" (where the coach is seen as the deity), the copy must strictly frame the *Prospect* as the one with the power, and the *Coach* as the catalyst/facilitator. If the prospect thinks *you* are the one performing the miracle, they will become dependent and high-maintenance. The power must remain "theirs," currently "dormant."
