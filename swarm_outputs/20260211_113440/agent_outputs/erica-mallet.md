**SUMMARY**
We are shifting the brand from a "repair shop" (Rebuild) to a "temple of power" (Resurrection). By framing this as **Dormant Power Reactivation**, we eliminate the "broken" stigma and replace it with a high-status invitation to reclaim a lost version of excellence that the "Empire-Building" process suppressed.

**KEY FINDINGS**
- **The "Rebuild" Trap:** A "Rebuild" implies the executive is currently a pile of rubble. This triggers a defensive psychological response in high-performers. **Resurrection** triggers curiosity and a sense of "I remember that guy."
- **The Enemy – "The Settled Self":** The enemy isn't failure; it's the version of the client that became a "steward" of their business instead of its "conqueror."
- **Belief-Based Differentiation:** We aren't selling coaching; we are selling the belief that your most powerful self didn't die—it just went into hibernation to survive the grind.

### **RECOMMENDATIONS & REWRITES**

#### **OFFER 1: The Intensive (The $4,997 Bridge)**
*   **The Hook:** "You’ve built the world around you, but you’ve felt the pilot light go dim. You aren't interested in maintenance; you are intrigued by **The Resurrection**."
*   **The Structure:** "This is Phase 1 of **The Resurrection**: The excavation of the dormant power that got you here."
*   **The Upsell:** "Once we’ve cleared the noise, you will have the option to upgrade to the full 90-day **Resurrection** protocol."
*   **The Pricing:** 
    *   Option 1: Upgrade to **The Resurrection**.
    *   **The Resurrection**: 10,000.
    *   **The Integrated Path**: Intensive ($4,997) + Resurrection ($10,000) = Total Investment: $14,997 (or $12,497 bundled).
*   **FAQ (Why not just start with The Resurrection?):** 
    "Because a Resurrection requires a clean site. The Intensive is the controlled burn of the 'Settled Self.' We clear the brush so the dormant power has room to breathe. Most start here to ensure the foundation can handle the voltage of the full reactivation."

#### **OFFER 2: The Core Offer ($10,000)**
*   **The Delivery:** "What **The Resurrection** delivers is not a 'new you,' but the *real* you—unburdened by the tactical fatigue of the last decade."
*   **The Call to Action:** "If you are ready to stop managing your decline and start leading your reactivation, move forward with **The Resurrection**."
*   **The Closing Line:** "You didn't build an empire to become its servant. This is **The Resurrection**. Claim what’s yours."

#### **THE BOOKING PAGE (8 Questions)**
1.  "Are you ready to move forward with **The Resurrection** (10K, 90 days) to reactivate your dormant edge?"
2.  "**The Resurrection** is a high-voltage process; it may not be the right fit if you are looking for 'coping mechanisms' rather than total reactivation."
3.  "**The Resurrection** requires the full commitment of the man you used to be. Are you ready to meet him again?"
4.  "What is the specific power-center you are **reactivating** toward? (What did you lose while building the empire?)"
5.  "Let’s talk about **The Resurrection** and whether your current infrastructure can support your return to peak."
*   **Auto-Reply (Rejection):** "Based on your profile, you aren't ready for **The Resurrection** yet. We specialize in dormant power, but we require a baseline of 'Empire-Ready' stability. We wish you the best in your current phase."

#### **PHASE 3 LEAD GEN (6 DM Scripts)**
1.  "I see the empire you've built, but I wonder if the Architect is still awake. Let’s **map The Resurrection**."
2.  "Success often acts as a sedative. If you feel like you're playing a character of yourself, we should **map The Resurrection**."
3.  "Most guys at your level think they need a vacation. You don't need a rest; you need a **Resurrection**. Want to see the map?"
4.  "You've conquered the market, but have you lost the 'Killer' that started it? Let's **map the Resurrection** of that dormant power."
5.  "There's a version of you that was more dangerous than the one I see today. Let’s **map The Resurrection** and bring him back."
6.  "The 'Rebuild' is for people who are broken. **The Resurrection** is for titans who went dormant. Ready to map it out?"

**CONFIDENCE**: High. Shifting from "Rebuild" to "Resurrection" creates an immediate "Category of One" positioning.

**DISSENT**: The term "Resurrection" has heavy religious overtones. While this creates "Tribal Belonging" for many, it may alienate hyper-secular or atheistic executives if not framed strictly as "Dormant Power Reactivation." Ensure the visual branding stays "Modern Titan" rather than "Gothic/Religious" to maintain the premium executive feel.
