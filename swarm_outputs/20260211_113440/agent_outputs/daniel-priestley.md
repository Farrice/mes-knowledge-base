**SUMMARY**
The shift from "Rebuild" to "Resurrection" moves the brand from a *repair-based* utility to a *power-based* transformation. By applying the **Oversubscribed** methodology, we position this not as a service to be bought, but as a high-stakes "Reactivation Event" for which only a select few are currently qualified.

**KEY FINDINGS**
- **The "Broken" Fallacy:** "Rebuild" implies the executive is broken or in crisis, which creates "low-status" tension. "Resurrection" implies the power is already there—it’s just dormant—positioning the coach as a catalyst for latent genius rather than a mechanic for a broken life.
- **Capacity Signaling:** To be oversubscribed, the "Resurrection" must feel like a limited-capacity resource. The 10K price point is a filter, but the *language* of dormant power is the true gatekeeper.
- **The Tension Gap:** The marketing must highlight the tension between the "Empire Builder" (who they are externally) and the "Dormant Giant" (who they have neglected internally).

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

### 1. OFFER 1: The Resurrection Intensive ($4,997 Bridge)
*   **Intrigue:** "You are intrigued by **The Resurrection**—the process of reclaiming the high-voltage version of yourself that went dormant while you were busy building the empire."
*   **Phase 1:** "This is Phase 1 of **The Resurrection**. We aren't fixing what’s broken; we are waking up what’s quiet."
*   **The Upgrade:** "After this Intensive, you have the option to upgrade to the full 90-day **Resurrection** protocol."
*   **The Option:** "Option 1: Upgrade to **The Resurrection**."
*   **Pricing:** "**The Resurrection: 10,000**."
*   **FAQ (Why not start with the full program?):** "Because dormant power requires a specific frequency of activation before it can be sustained. The Intensive ensures your internal systems can handle the voltage of the full **Resurrection**. It’s the difference between a spark and a continuous current."
*   **Recalculation:** "Individual investment: $14,997. **Integrated Momentum Path: $12,497** (A $2,500 credit toward your reactivation)."

### 2. OFFER 2: The Resurrection (10K Core Offer)
*   **Deliverables:** "What **The Resurrection** delivers is not a new you, but the *real* you—the one who built the empire before the weight of it forced your power into dormancy."
*   **The Close:** "If you are ready to stop managing the decline and start leading the reactivation, let's move forward with **The Resurrection**."
*   **Final Framing:** "This is not a repair. It is a reactivation. This is **The Resurrection**."

### 3. BOOKING PAGE (The Filter)
*   **The Commitment:** "Are you ready to move forward with **The Resurrection** (10K investment, 90-day reactivation)?"
*   **The Fit:** "**The Resurrection** may not be the right fit if you are looking for a 'fix.' This is for those looking to release power that is currently being suppressed by their own success."
*   **The Requirement:** "**The Resurrection** requires a total commitment to the version of you that is currently dormant. Half-measures will not wake a giant."
*   **The Direction:** "What is the specific power you feel is currently dormant that you are **Resurrecting TOWARD**?"
*   **The Call:** "Let’s talk about **The Resurrection**."

### 4. REJECTION MESSAGES (The "Not Yet" Signal)
*   "Based on your intake, you aren't ready for **The Resurrection** yet. This protocol requires a level of foundational stability you haven't reached. We don't wake the giant until the ground is firm."

### 5. PHASE 3 LEAD GEN (DM Scripts)
*   **Script A:** "I’ve been watching your trajectory. You’ve built the empire, but I suspect the man who started it has gone dormant. Want to **map the Resurrection** of that original power?"
*   **Script B:** "Most guys at your level are just 'rebuilding.' We’re doing something different. We’re **mapping the Resurrection** of dormant power. Open to a chat?"

**CONFIDENCE**: High

**DISSENT**
Traditional "pain-point" marketers might argue that "Resurrection" is too abstract compared to "Rebuild." However, in the premium executive space ($10K+), executives are tired of being "fixed." They respond better to the "Key Person of Influence" framing—that they are already great, but have simply become "dormant" under the weight of their own success. The word "Resurrection" creates a higher status for the buyer.
