**SUMMARY**
We are shifting the narrative from a "repair" identity (The Rebuild) to a "sovereignty" identity (The Resurrection). In the StoryBrand framework, the client is no longer a victim of a broken system, but a sleeping giant whose internal "operating system" has gone dormant; my recommendations install the language of **dormant power reactivation** to ensure the client feels they are reclaiming an empire rather than fixing a failure.

**KEY FINDINGS**
*   **Identity Friction:** The term "Rebuild" unintentionally signals that the executive is "broken," which triggers shame—the ultimate conversion killer for high-performers.
*   **The Resurrection Reframe:** By defining Resurrection as "Dormant Power Reactivation," we position the coach not as a mechanic, but as an **activator** of a pre-existing, superior version of the client.
*   **Language-Reality Loop:** Using "Resurrection" creates a psychological "gap" between who they are now (stagnant) and who they were at their peak (dormant), making the $10K price point feel like a bargain for reclaiming their former lethality.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

**1. OFFER 1: The Intensive ($4,997 Bridge Offer)**
*   **Initial Hook:** "You aren't looking for a fix; you are drawn to **The Resurrection**—the reactivation of the executive power that built your empire but went quiet while you were managing it."
*   **Phase 1 Framing:** "This is Phase 1 of **The Resurrection**: The Diagnostic Strike. We locate the exact point where your primary power went dormant."
*   **The Upsell:** "After today, you can ascend to the full 90-day **Resurrection** protocol. If you choose to upgrade now, we apply your Intensive investment toward the total."
*   **The Math:** "The Intensive ($4,997) + The Resurrection ($10,000) = $14,997. When bundled today, we bypass the bridge and move straight to full reactivation."
*   **FAQ (Why not start with Resurrection?):** "Because a dormant engine needs a spark before it can handle a full-throttle burn. The Intensive is the spark; **The Resurrection** is the sustained fire. Most start here to prove to themselves that the power is still there."

**2. OFFER 2: The Core Offer ($10,000)**
*   **Deliverables:** "**The Resurrection** delivers a total recapture of your original vision, stripped of the fatigue and 'noise' that put your power to sleep. You aren't learning new skills; you are waking up the master who already knows how to win."
*   **The Call to Action:** "If you are ready to stop managing your decline and start leading your return, move forward with **The Resurrection**."
*   **The Closing Line:** "This isn't a renovation project. This is **The Resurrection**: The return of your most lethal, dormant self."

**3. BOOKING PAGE (Reframed Questions)**
1.  "Are you prepared to fund the $10,000 investment for the 90-day **Resurrection** of your dormant power?"
2.  "**The Resurrection** is not a 'fix-it' shop for the broken. It is a reactivation chamber for the powerful. Why is now the time to wake up?"
3.  "**The Resurrection** requires a 'scorched earth' commitment to the version of you that is waking up. Are you ready to let the dormant version take the lead?"
4.  "Instead of rebuilding toward a goal, what empire-level vision are you **reactivating from** your past success?"
5.  "If we decide **The Resurrection** is not the right fit, it’s usually because the desire for comfort outweighs the desire for power. Do you agree?"
6.  "What is the single biggest 'power leak' you want to plug during **The Resurrection**?"
7.  "When we talk about **The Resurrection**, are you looking for a strategy or a total identity reactivation?"
8.  "**Auto-Reply Rejection:** 'Based on your application, you aren't looking for a Resurrection; you're looking for a repair. We don't do repairs. We wake giants. When you're ready to reactivate your dormant power, find us again.'"

**4. PHASE 3 LEAD GEN (DM Scripts)**
*   *Script 1:* "I saw your recent win. Most people see the result; I see the dormant power behind it. Ever thought about what a full **Resurrection** of that original drive would look like?"
*   *Script 2:* "You've built the empire, but has the 'builder' gone dormant? Let's map **The Resurrection** of that 2.0 version of you."
*   *Script 3:* "The fatigue you're feeling isn't burnout; it's dormancy. Your power is bored. Let's hop on a call to map **The Resurrection** sequence."

**CONFIDENCE: High**

**DISSENT**
The term "Resurrection" carries heavy religious and "end-of-life" connotations. To avoid the brand sounding like a funeral home or a ministry, the copy **must** obsessively pair the word "Resurrection" with the modifier **"Dormant Power Reactivation."** If we lose that modifier, the brand loses its "Executive" edge and begins to sound like a recovery program for the broken, which will repel the $10K high-performer. We must maintain the "King returning to the throne" archetype, not the "Lazarus being raised from the dead" archetype.
