**SUMMARY**
We are pivoting "The Resurrection Coach" from a "repair shop" brand (fixing what is broken) to a "power plant" brand (reactivating dormant energy). By replacing crisis-shame language with diagnostic-premium terminology, we move the prospect from a state of guilt to a state of strategic reclamation.

**KEY FINDINGS**
*   **The Shame Ceiling:** High-level executives paying $10k+ do not respond well to being called "cowards"; it triggers ego-defense. They respond to "inefficiency" or "dormancy," which frames the problem as a technical error rather than a moral failing.
*   **The Power of "Corrupted Code":** This metaphor shifts the blame from the person to the *system* they are running, making the "Resurrection" a logical upgrade rather than a desperate salvage mission.
*   **Body-First Logic:** In a premium context, "body-first" must be framed as "hardware optimization." You cannot run high-performance "Resurrection" software on "corrupted" physical hardware.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

**CONTENT TYPE 1: LINKEDIN REWRITES**
*   *Option 1 (The Performance Gap):* "You aren't failing; you're just operating at 40% capacity and calling it 'efficiency' because you’ve forgotten what your true edge feels like."
*   *Option 2 (The Gilded Cage):* "The most dangerous state for a leader isn't rock bottom—it's high-functioning dormancy. You’ve built the empire, but the version of you that enjoyed the conquest has gone offline."
*   *Option 3 (The System Error):* "Success often acts as a sedative. If you feel like a shadow of your former self, it’s not a character flaw—it’s a system running on corrupted code that prioritizes safety over sovereignty."

**CONTENT TYPE 2: EMAIL SEQUENCES**
*   **The "Body-First" Reframe:** "This is why The Resurrection is body-first: You cannot reactivate dormant power through 'mindset' alone if your nervous system is still running on corrupted, survival-mode code. We optimize the hardware (the body) so the software (your vision) can finally execute at scale."
*   **Phrase Swaps:**
    *   "What The Resurrection looks like (90 days)"
    *   "This is The Resurrection"
    *   "Map the Resurrection"
    *   "The Resurrection requires..."
    *   "Move forward with The Resurrection"

**CONTENT TYPE 3: 90-DAY CONTENT CALENDAR**
*   **Act 3 Reframe:** "Act 3: The Resurrection — The Reactivation Protocol."
*   **Week 1-4 Context:** "Weeks 1-4 of The Resurrection: System Diagnostics & Baseline Reclamation. We identify where your power went dormant and begin the 'hardware' reset."
*   **Premium CTAs:** "Initiate Your Resurrection" or "Reclaim Your Sovereign Edge."
*   **Target Audience:** "Who The Resurrection Is For: The high-achiever who is tired of 'maintaining' and ready to reactivate the dormant power that built their empire in the first place."

**5 DORMANT POWER SNIPPETS**
1.  "We don’t rebuild from scratch; we excavate the fire that went dormant while you were busy being 'reasonable'."
2.  "The Resurrection isn't about fixing a broken man—it’s about reactivating a powerful one who has been buried under the weight of his own success."
3.  "Your current plateau isn't a lack of skill. It’s a dormant power surge waiting for the right code to be reactivated."
4.  "Most coaching asks you to do more. The Resurrection asks you to *be* who you were before you started compromising for the sake of the 'empire'."
5.  "If you feel like you're 'going through the motions,' your system is throttled. We don't fix the motions; we unthrottle the source."

**CONFIDENCE**: High

**DISSENT**
While "Resurrection" is a powerful brand anchor, it carries heavy religious connotations. To maintain the "Executive/Premium" feel, it must be consistently paired with technical or architectural language (Systems, Code, Reactivation, Sovereignty) to ensure it isn't mistaken for a spiritual or "woo-woo" program. Use the "Dormant Power" framing as the primary sub-definition to keep it grounded in performance.
