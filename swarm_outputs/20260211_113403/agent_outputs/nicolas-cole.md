**SUMMARY**
The transition from "The Rebuild" to "The Resurrection" shifts the narrative from fixing a broken past to reactivating a dormant future. By applying economic compression and terminal word power, we remove the shame-heavy "crisis" language and replace it with diagnostic, premium prose that treats the executive as a high-performance system requiring a specialized software update.

**KEY FINDINGS**
*   **Terminal Word Impact:** In the previous copy, "smile" or "coward" held the power position. In the new brand, the final word of the sentence must land on "Power," "Edge," "Code," or "Resurrection" to anchor the reader in the solution.
*   **Vocabulary Calibration:** Moving from "shame" (coward, broken) to "diagnostics" (dormant, corrupted, legacy code) elevates the status of the client. They aren't a failure; they are an elite machine running an outdated operating system.
*   **Rhythm Engineering:** Short, punchy sentences are used for the diagnosis ("Your edge is buried.") while longer, rhythmic sentences are used to describe the 90-day trajectory of the Resurrection.

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

**Content Type 1: LinkedIn (Replacement for "You are just a coward with a smile")**
1. "You aren't failing; you are operating on corrupted code."
2. "The polite smile is masking a dormant edge."
3. "You have traded your raw power for social convenience."

**Content Type 2: Email Sequences**
*   "What The Resurrection looks like (90 days)"
*   "This is The Resurrection"
*   "Map the Resurrection"
*   "The Resurrection requires"
*   "Move forward with The Resurrection"
*   **Body-First Framing:** "The Resurrection is body-first because you cannot run elite software on depleted hardware."

**Content Type 3: 90-Day Content Calendar**
*   **Act 3:** "The Resurrection — Reactivate the Edge."
*   **Week 1-4:** "The Resurrection: Diagnostic Alignment and System Reset."
*   **CTA:** "Reclaim your dormant power." or "Begin the Resurrection."

**5 Paragraph Snippets (Dormant Power Voice):**
1. "The empire you built shouldn't cost you your vitality. We don't fix what is broken; we reactivate what went dormant while you were busy winning."
2. "Most executives think they’ve lost their edge. They haven't. It’s simply buried under the weight of legacy systems and corrupted daily habits."
3. "Resurrection isn't about starting over. It's about stripping away the polite facade to reveal the high-performance animal underneath."
4. "Your current success is a gilded cage. To break out, we don't need a rebuild; we need a total system reactivation."
5. "Stop managing your decline. The Resurrection is the process of reclaiming the version of yourself that was once unstoppable."

**CONFIDENCE**: High

**DISSENT**
The term "Resurrection" carries heavy religious overtones that can skew "soft" or "spiritual" if not anchored by the diagnostic, technical vocabulary (code, hardware, systems) I have implemented. If the copy becomes too poetic, it loses the premium executive "diagnostic" feel. We must maintain the tension between the high-concept name and the clinical execution.
