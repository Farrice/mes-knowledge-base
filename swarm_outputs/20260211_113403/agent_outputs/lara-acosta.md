**SUMMARY**
The shift from 'The Rebuild' to 'The Resurrection' moves the brand from a "repair shop" (low-status) to a "high-performance laboratory" (high-status). By framing the process as **Dormant Power Reactivation**, we transition from fixing a broken man to optimizing a high-tier system running on legacy code, which significantly increases the perceived value for 10K+ executive clients.

**KEY FINDINGS**
- **The "Broken" Paradox**: High-level executives do not identify as "broken." They identify as "under-optimized." The previous language (coward, rock bottom) created cognitive dissonance that repelled the ICP (Ideal Client Profile).
- **System-First Psychology**: Using metaphors like "corrupted code" and "dormant power" aligns with the executive's mental model of their business, making the coaching feel like a necessary "system upgrade" rather than "therapy."
- **Positioning over Content**: "The Resurrection" as a title is a power-move; it implies a return to a state of sovereignty that the client already knows they possess, reducing the friction of the "sale."

**RECOMMENDATIONS**

**1. Content Type 1: LinkedIn Rewrites (The Diagnostic Approach)**
*   *Option 1*: "The smile isn't a sign of peace; it’s a high-performance mask for a system running on corrupted legacy code."
*   *Option 2*: "You haven't lost your edge. You've buried it under the weight of the empire you built to protect it."
*   *Option 3*: "The most dangerous state for a leader isn't failure—it's high-functioning dormancy. You are performing, but you aren't present."

**2. Content Type 2: Email Sequence & Body-First Framing**
*   *Body-First Rewrite*: "This is why The Resurrection is body-first: You cannot run a Tier-1 operating system on Tier-3 hardware. To reactivate your dormant power, we must first upgrade the vessel that hosts it. We don't train for aesthetics; we train for bandwidth."
*   *Workflow terminology*: 
    *   "The Resurrection Protocol (90 days)"
    *   "Initiate The Resurrection"
    *   "Map the Reactivation"

**3. Content Type 3: 90-Day Calendar & Snippets**
*   **Act 3 Reframe**: "Act 3: The Resurrection — Reclaiming the Sovereign Self."
*   **Week 1-4 Reframe**: "Week 1-4 of The Resurrection: The System Audit (Identifying Ghost Power)."
*   **Premium CTAs**: "Claim Your Resurrection" or "Reactivate Your Edge."
*   **5 Snippets (Dormant Power Voice)**:
    1. "Success didn't kill your hunger; it archived it. The Resurrection is the process of unearthing the killer instinct that built your empire, then refining it for the next one."
    2. "Most coaches try to 'fix' you. I 'reactivate' you. You aren't a project; you are a powerhouse running a suboptimal configuration."
    3. "The Resurrection is not a return to who you were. It is an evolution into the version of you that your current success demands, but your current habits can’t sustain."
    4. "We don't look for problems to solve. We look for dormant power to ignite. Your edge hasn't left; it’s just waiting for the right command prompt."
    5. "High-performance is a liability if the pilot has gone dormant. The Resurrection restores the architect to the cockpit of the empire."

**CONFIDENCE**: High

**DISSENT**
While "The Resurrection" is a powerful brand name, it carries heavy religious/spiritual overtones that can occasionally lean toward "woo-woo" if not anchored by the **Diagnostic/Systemic** language. To maintain the 10K executive positioning, ensure the visual identity and the supporting copy stay rooted in "High-Performance Systems" to avoid being mistaken for a spiritual retreat. We are selling *sovereignty*, not just *salvation*.
