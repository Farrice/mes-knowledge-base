## Executive Summary

$2,000/month is **solidly mid-tier** pricing for LinkedIn ghostwriting—positioned as premium-accessible rather than luxury. The ROI math is devastating: One consulting client ($10K-$50K) pays for 6-24 months of service. Market supports $2K-$5K range confidently.

## The "No-Brainer" Calculation

| Client Profile | Annual Revenue | Monthly Service | Annual Cost | Break-Even |
|---------------|---------------|-----------------|-------------|------------|
| Consultant ($200K+) | $200,000 | $2,000 | $24,000 | **1 client @ $24K** |
| Founder ($500K+) | $500,000 | $3,000 | $36,000 | **1 client @ $36K** |
| Executive ($1M+) | $1,000,000 | $5,000 | $60,000 | **1 client @ $60K** |

**Reality Check**: Most consultants charge $10K-$50K per client. **One deal pays for 6-24 months of ghostwriting.**

## Price Positioning Recommendation

| Your Price | Market Position | Justification |
|------------|----------------|---------------|

## Unit Economics

For a solo operator (Farrice) at $2K/month:
- **4 clients** = $8,000/month = $96K annually
- **6 clients** = $12,000/month = $144K annually (close to $10-15K/mo target)
- **10 clients** = $20,000/month = $240K annually (exceeds goal)

**Time Investment**: 30-min brain dump + 4-6 hours processing/month per client = 5-7 hours max.

## Dissent/Reservations

- Entry-tier competition is fierce ($800-$1,500 range is crowded)
- Must demonstrate clear differentiation from AI content mills
- "Voice extraction" must be provably superior, not just claimed
