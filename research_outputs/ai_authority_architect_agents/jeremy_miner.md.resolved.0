# Agent Output: Jeremy Miner — Objection Mapping

> **Role**: Objection Hunter | **Confidence**: HIGH

---

## Executive Summary

Mapped 8 core objections a Conscious Founder will raise. Key insight: Most objections aren't price-related—they're identity and risk-related. The sale is made when they see you as "safe to trust with my voice."

---

## Identity Transformation Required for Purchase

### Current Identity
> "I'm a founder who's too busy to post, tried ghostwriters who didn't get me, and would rather be silent than fake."

### Target Identity (Post-Purchase)
> "I'm a founder who has a secret weapon — someone who actually captured my voice and freed me from the content burden."

---

## The 8 Core Objections

### Objection 1: "It won't sound like me"
**Type**: RISK / IDENTITY

**What They're Really Saying**:
> "I've been burned before. My reputation is on the line."

**Reframe**:
> "That's exactly why I built MES 3.0 — specifically because I was frustrated seeing founders settle for content that didn't capture their genius. Let me show you a 60-second audio clip of a client before and after. You can hear the difference."

---

### Objection 2: "I don't have time even for onboarding"
**Type**: PRACTICAL

**What They're Really Saying**:
> "Everything requires more of me, and I have nothing left to give."

**Reframe**:
> "Everything I need comes from one 30-minute conversation per month. That's less time than you spend on a single client call. And that one call produces 30 days of content."

---

### Objection 3: "I'm not sure I need LinkedIn content"
**Type**: PRIORITY

**What They're Really Saying**:
> "I don't see the ROI clearly enough."

**Reframe Questions** (NEPQ):
- "When was the last time a client found you through your LinkedIn?"
- "What would it mean for your business if the right people saw you as THE expert in your space?"
- "If your competitors are building authority on LinkedIn and you're not, where does that leave you in 18 months?"

---

### Objection 4: "I tried a ghostwriter before and it didn't work"
**Type**: PAST FAILURE

**What They're Really Saying**:
> "I don't trust that this will be different."

**Reframe**:
> "What specifically didn't work? [Let them vent] Most ghostwriters fail because they focus on WHAT to write, not HOW you think. MES 3.0 starts with your thought patterns, values, and mental models — then the content flows from there. That's why it sounds like you."

---

### Objection 5: "It's too expensive"
**Type**: VALUE PERCEPTION

**What They're Really Saying**:
> "I don't see enough ROI to justify this."

**Reframe**:
> "If a LinkedIn post led to one speaking invite, one podcast appearance, or one consulting client — what would that be worth? For most founders like you, one deal covers the entire year. The question isn't whether you can afford it, but whether you can afford to stay invisible."

---

### Objection 6: "Why should I trust you specifically?"
**Type**: CREDIBILITY

**What They're Really Saying**:
> "Who are you to serve someone at my level?"

**Reframe**:
> "I've spent 18 years studying human psychology and behavior change. Not marketing — psychology. I designed MES 3.0 specifically because I saw ghostwriters failing at the one thing that matters: actually capturing how someone thinks. I'm also a founder who refused to use generic AI content for the same reasons you would."

---

### Objection 7: "Can I see examples of your work?"
**Type**: PROOF REQUIREMENT

**What They're Really Saying**:
> "Show me evidence before I take a risk."

**Reframe**:
> "Absolutely. Here are before/after samples [share docs]. You'll notice the 'after' doesn't just sound better — it sounds like a SPECIFIC person, not a generic thought leader. That's the difference."

---

### Objection 8: "I need to think about it"
**Type**: STALL / UNCERTAINTY

**What They're Really Saying**:
> "I'm not sold yet but don't want to say no."

**Reframe Questions**:
- "What specifically would you need to feel confident moving forward?"
- "Is there something I haven't addressed that's giving you pause?"
- "If we could solve [their stated concern], would this be a fit?"

---

## Pre-Frame Strategy

Before objections arise, inoculate with:

1. **"Most ghostwriters fail for one reason"** — frames MES 3.0 as the solution
2. **"I only work with 6 clients"** — creates scarcity, implies selectivity
3. **"If the content doesn't sound like you, we rebuild it"** — removes risk
4. **"My clients are founders who refused to settle for AI content"** — identity signaling

---

## Recommendation

**ADDRESS OBJECTION #1 FIRST.** The "it won't sound like me" fear is so dominant that until it's neutralized, price and time objections don't even matter. Lead every conversation with proof of voice capture.
