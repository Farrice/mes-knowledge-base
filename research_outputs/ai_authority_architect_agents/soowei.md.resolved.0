# Agent Output: SooWei — Service Model Analysis

> **Role**: Consulting Architecture | **Confidence**: HIGH

## Executive Summary

Analyzed competing service models. Key insight: Most ghostwriting services require 10-15 hours/week per client. MES 3.0's "brain dump" model can compress to 5-7 hours/month, enabling 6-10 clients within Farrice's 1-3 hour/day constraint.

## Competitor Service Model Comparison

### Model 1: Full-Service Agency (Cleverly, SalesBread)

| Attribute | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Time per Client** | 10-15 hours/month (writing, calls, revisions) |
| **Team** | Writers, strategists, account managers |
| **Price** | $2,000-$5,000/month |
| **Margin** | 30-40% (high overhead) |
| **Scalability** | High (throw more people at it) |
| **Personal Touch** | Low (you're a number) |

**Gap**: Impersonal, clients feel like commodities

---

### Model 2: Solo Operator (Most freelancers)

| Attribute | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Time per Client** | 15-20 hours/month (no systems) |
| **Team** | Just the freelancer |
| **Price** | $1,000-$3,000/month |
| **Margin** | 70-80% (low overhead) |
| **Scalability** | Low (capacity ceiling) |
| **Personal Touch** | High (but unsustainable) |

**Gap**: Burns out, can't scale, often under-prices

---

### Model 3: Educator (Dickie Bush, Justin Welsh)

| Attribute | Reality |
|-----------|---------|
| **Time per Client** | N/A (sells courses) |
| **Team** | Content + tech support |
| **Price** | $150-$500 one-time |
| **Margin** | 85%+ |
| **Scalability** | Infinite |
| **Personal Touch** | Zero (no done-for-you) |

**Gap**: Doesn't solve "I don't have time to execute"

---

### Model 4: MES 3.0 Architecture (Proposed)

| Attribute | Design |
|-----------|--------|
| **Time per Client** | 5-7 hours/month |
| **Team** | Solo + AI extraction system |
| **Price** | $2,000-$5,000/month |
| **Margin** | 80%+ |
| **Scalability** | 6-10 clients (intentional cap) |
| **Personal Touch** | HIGH (you ARE the system) |

---

## Time Budget Analysis

### Farrice's Constraint: 1-3 hours/day = 20-60 hours/month

**Per-Client Time Breakdown (MES 3.0 Model)**:

| Activity | Hours/Month |
|----------|-------------|
| Initial Brain Dump (1x) | 0.5 |
| Monthly Check-in | 0.5 |
| Content Processing via AI | 2-3 |
| Strategic Review & Editing | 1-2 |
| Client Communication | 0.5-1 |
| **TOTAL** | 5-7 hours |

**Client Capacity**:
- At 20 hours/month (1 hr/day): 3-4 clients
- At 40 hours/month (2 hr/day): 6-8 clients
- At 60 hours/month (3 hr/day): 8-10 clients

---

## Revenue Scenarios

| Clients | Monthly Rate | Monthly Revenue | Annual |
|---------|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| 4 | $2,000 | $8,000 | $96,000 |
| 4 | $3,500 | $14,000 | $168,000 |
| 6 | $2,500 | $15,000 | $180,000 |
| 8 | $2,500 | $20,000 | $240,000 |
| 10 | $3,000 | $30,000 | $360,000 |

**Target**: 6 clients @ $3K = $18K/month (within family-first constraint)

---

## Leverage Architecture

### What Creates Leverage

| Lever | How It Works |
|-------|--------------|
| **MES 3.0 System** | AI does 60-70% of content generation |
| **Brain Dump Format** | Client time = 30 min/month, not hours of calls |
| **Template Library** | Reusable formats accelerate production |
| **Async-First** | No back-to-back client calls |
| **Capacity Scarcity** | Waiting list creates premium positioning |

### What Kills Leverage

| Anti-Lever | Mitigation |
|------------|------------|
| Unlimited revisions | Cap at 2 rounds per post |
| Scope creep | Clear deliverables (X posts only) |
| Real-time availability | Office hours, not on-demand |
| Under-pricing | $2K minimum maintains premium |

---

## Recommended Tier Structure

| Tier | Price | Deliverables | Ideal For |
|------|-------|--------------|-----------|
| **Authority Launch** | $2,000/mo | 8 posts, 1 brain dump, 1 call | Testing fit |
| **Authority Accelerator** | $3,500/mo | 12 posts, 2 brain dumps, 2 calls, content calendar | Most clients |
| **Authority Partner** | $5,000/mo | 16 posts, unlimited brain dumps, weekly call, repurposing | Enterprise founders |

---

## Recommendation

**BUILD FOR 6 CLIENTS AT $3K.** This hits $18K/month (close to $20K target) while staying within 2-hour/day work constraint. Use waiting list to create premium scarcity once capacity is reached.
