## Messaging Patterns (What's Overused)

| Overused Phrase | Why It Fails | Alternative |
|-----------------|--------------|-------------|
| "Grow your brand" | Abstract, everyone says it | "Be recognized by name" |
| "Thought leadership" | Cliché, eye-roll inducing | "Expertise people reference" |
| "Stand out" | Vague, unprovable | "Get cited in industry reports" |
| "Scale your content" | Production-focused, not outcome | "30 posts from 30 minutes" |
| "Viral content" | Vanity metric, not buyer value | "Content that lands clients" |

## Trust Words to Use

Based on competitor gap analysis, these words create differentiation:

| Trust Word | Why It Works |
|------------|--------------|
| **"Extraction"** | Technical, implies methodology |
| **"Brain Dump"** | Casual, de-mystifies process |
| **"Your Voice"** | Directly addresses #1 fear |
| **"100% You"** | Falsifiable guarantee |
| **"30 Minutes"** | Specific time commitment |
| **"Proprietary System"** | Implies unique methodology |
| **"Authority Asset"** | Better than "content" |

---

## Words to Avoid

| Word | Why Avoid |
|------|-----------|
| "Viral" | Vanity metric, not outcome |
| "Engagement" | Algorithm-speak, not business result |
| "Scale" | Production-focused, cold |
| "Growth hacking" | Outdated, bro-marketing |
| "Optimize" | Generic, overused |

---

## Recommendation

**LEAD WITH THE "30/30" FORMULA.** It's specific, falsifiable, and passes the one-second test. "30 minutes of your genius → 30 days of LinkedIn content" is a hook no competitor is using.
