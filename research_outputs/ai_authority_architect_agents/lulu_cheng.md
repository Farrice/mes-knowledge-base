## Executive Summary

Farrice has a unique angle for founder communications: the intersection of AI, psychology, and authenticity. This is a media-friendly narrative that could generate podcast appearances, guest posts, and speaking opportunities—all of which feed the client acquisition engine.

## Narrative Positioning

### The Media-Friendly Story
> "A behavior change psychologist who spent 18 years helping people transform, now using AI to solve the 'AI sounds robotic' problem. He built a system that captures someone's authentic voice in 30 minutes and produces content indistinguishable from self-written."

**Why It Works**:
- **Timely**: AI content is THE story in 2025
- **Contrarian**: AI making content MORE human (unexpected)
- **Human**: Father-first values in hustle culture landscape
- **Specific**: Not just "AI content" — voice extraction methodology

---

## Three Narrative Lanes

### Lane 1: "AI That Sounds Human" (For Business/Tech Media)
**Angle**: The technical innovation
**Key Message**: "Most AI content sounds robotic because it's trained on generic patterns. MES 3.0 extracts individual thought patterns — the result is AI-assisted content that passes the authenticity test."
**Outlets**: Fast Company, Wired, business podcasts

### Lane 2: "Father-First Founder" (For Lifestyle/Founder Media)
**Angle**: The values story
**Key Message**: "I refused to sacrifice family for followers. So I built a system that gives me leverage without compromise. Now I help other conscious founders do the same."
**Outlets**: My First Million, How I Built This, founder podcasts

### Lane 3: "Psychology of Authenticity" (For LinkedIn/Professional)
**Angle**: The expertise demonstration
**Key Message**: "The reason your content doesn't sound like you isn't the writing — it's the extraction. Most ghostwriters ask 'what do you want to say?' The right question is 'how do you think?'"
**Outlets**: LinkedIn native content, guest posts, industry podcasts
