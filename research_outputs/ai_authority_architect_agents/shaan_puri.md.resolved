## Executive Summary

Applied the "Intention + Obstacle" framework to Farrice's narrative. Three signature stories should be repeated in different forms. The "wounded healer" story is the anchor. Each story builds toward the same positioning: the authority who solved his own invisibility problem.

## The Intention + Obstacle Framework

Every viral story follows:
> **Character with Intention** meets **Obstacle** → Transformation

### Farrice's Core Story
- **Character**: Psychology expert who helps others transform
- **Intention**: Share expertise online without sacrificing family/authenticity
- **Obstacle**: Couldn't find a ghostwriter who sounded like him; AI was robotic
- **Transformation**: Built MES 3.0 to solve the problem

## The 3 Signature Stories

### Story 1: "The Wounded Healer"
**Angle**: I solved my own problem

**The Story**:
> For 18 years, I helped people transform. I was great at it. But when it came to showing up online myself? I was invisible.
> 
> I hired ghostwriters. They didn't get me. I tried AI. It sounded like everyone else. I could help anyone but myself.
> 
> So I did what I do best: I went deep into the psychology. Why do we sound different on the page than in person? What makes someone's voice THEIR voice?
> 
> That research became MES 3.0. A system that captures someone's thinking in 30 minutes and produces content that sounds exactly like them.
> 
> Now I help other founders who refuse to sound like everyone else.

**Use When**: Origin story, "why I do this" contexts

### Story 2: "The Father's Choice"
**Angle**: I chose family over hustle

**The Story**:
> My son doesn't know me as "the entrepreneur who's always working."
> 
> He knows me as the dad who picks him up from school. Who's there for dinner. Who reads with him before bed.
> 
> I designed my business around one constraint: I can't miss those moments. That means no 12-hour days. No "grind now, live later."
> 
> When I built my content system, I built it for fathers like me. Founders who want to be visible online without invisible at home.
> 
> 30 minutes a month. That's all it takes. Because time with family isn't the reward for success. It IS success.

**Use When**: Values posts, resonance with parent founders

### Story 3: "The Client Who Almost Quit"
**Angle**: Transformation in action

**The Story**:
> [Client Name] almost fired me after the first draft.
> 
> "This doesn't sound like me at all," she said.
> 
> She was right. I'd made the classic ghostwriter mistake: I wrote what I thought she should say, not how she actually thinks.
> 
> So we did the extraction again. This time, I focused on her word patterns, her values hierarchy, the way she structures arguments.
> 
> The second draft? Her team asked, "When did you have time to write all this?"
> 
> She didn't. But it sounded so much like her, they couldn't tell.
> 
> That's when I knew MES 3.0 worked.

**Use When**: Proof posts, overcoming objections

## Hook Patterns

### The Reveal Hook
> "I spent $50K on ghostwriters before I figured this out."

### The Contrarian Hook
> "Most ghostwriters fail. And it's not because of their writing."

### The Number Hook
> "30 minutes. 30 days. 100% your voice."

### The Question Hook
> "What if you could have a library of content that sounds exactly like you?"

### The Confession Hook
> "I was invisible online for 15 years. Here's why."

## The "Repeat Until It's Your Thing" Rule

**Don't tell each story once. Tell it 10 times in different forms.**

| Form | Example |
|------|---------|
| Text post | Full narrative |
| Carousel | Steps/journey version |
| Quote graphic | Key line from story |
| Video | Spoken version |
| Reply | Reference in comments |
| Podcast | Extended version |

## Recommendation

**MASTER THE WOUNDED HEALER STORY FIRST.** It's the most powerful because it demonstrates expertise (solved own problem) + vulnerability (admits struggle). Tell it 10 ways over 90 days until it's inseparable from your brand.
