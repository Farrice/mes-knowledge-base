## Executive Summary

The goal isn't marketing—it's creating an idea that spreads itself. "30/30" and "Voice Extraction" are sticky concepts. The strategy: turn first clients into sneezers, build a referral flywheel, and position ideas to spread through conscious founder communities.

---

## The Ideavirus Framework

### What Makes an Idea Spread?
1. **Remarkable**: Worth remarking on
2. **Specific**: Easy to describe precisely
3. **Contagious**: Compels sharing
4. **Sneezer-Friendly**: Easy for enthusiasts to pass along

### Your Spreadable Ideas

| Idea | Remarkability Score |
|------|---------------------|
| "30/30" (30 min → 30 days) | 9/10 (specific, surprising) |
| "MES 3.0" | 6/10 (needs explanation) |
| "Voice Extraction" | 8/10 (new concept) |
| "Anti-Ghostwriter" | 8/10 (paradox) |
| "Conscious Founder" | 7/10 (identity tribal) |

## The Sneezer Strategy

### Who Are Your Sneezers?
Sneezers = people who will spread your idea to their networks

| Sneezer Type | Example | How to Activate |
|--------------|---------|-----------------|
| **Happy Clients** | Founders you've served | Ask for testimonial, make referral easy |
| **Adjacent Experts** | Coaches, consultants | Partner/referral relationship |
| **Community Leaders** | Podcast hosts, community managers | Guest appearances, value drops |
| **Peer Founders** | Other conscious founders | Relationship building, mutual support |

### Sneezer Activation Sequence

1. **Deliver exceptional result** → Client becomes advocate
2. **Make sharing easy** → One-click referral, quote graphics
3. **Reward referrals** → Referral bonus or thank-you gift
4. **Create sneezer content** → Content clients WANT to share

## The Referral Flywheel

```
Client Success
     ↓
Ask for Testimonial
     ↓
Client Shares (naturally or asked)
     ↓
New Leads Discover You
     ↓
Some Convert to Clients
     ↓
[Repeat with each new client]
```

### Accelerating the Flywheel

| Acceleration Tactic | Implementation |
|--------------------|----------------|
| **Referral bonus** | "Get 1 month free for each referral who signs" |
| **Co-branded content** | Client's post about working with you |
| **Sneezer gifts** | Thoughtful gift after referral converts |
| **Case study sharing** | Tag client when sharing their story |

## Ideas That Spread (Virus Engineering)

### The "30/30" Meme
> "I give Farrice 30 minutes per month. He gives me 30 days of content that sounds like me."

**Why It Spreads**:
- Specific numbers
- Clear value proposition
- Surprisingly simple
- Easy to retell

**Variation for Clients to Say**:
> "My LinkedIn is handled. 30 minutes a month. That's it."

### The "Voice Extraction" Concept
> "He doesn't write content FOR me. He extracts content FROM me."

**Why It Spreads**:
- New concept (curiosity)
- Distinction from alternatives
- Sounds technical/credible
- Creates questions

### The "Anti-Ghostwriter" Paradox
> "I hired a ghostwriter who hates ghostwriting."

**Why It Spreads**:
- Paradox creates intrigue
- Memorable contradiction
- Demands explanation
- Stands out

## Community Virus Points

### Where Conscious Founders Gather
| Community | Virus Strategy |
|-----------|----------------|
| Conscious Capitalism chapters | Speak/present on content for purpose-driven leaders |
| Pavilion | Value drops, relationship building |
| YPO/EO | Elite positioning, referral from members |
| Industry Slack groups | Be helpful, don't sell |
| Podcast shows | Share sneezer-ready ideas |

### Virus Content for Communities
- **Shareables**: One-liners, quote graphics, frameworks
- **Templates**: The 3-question voice extraction template
- **Insights**: "What I learned from 50 founder LinkedIn audits"

---

## Referral Mechanics

### Simple Referral Ask
> "If you know any other conscious founders who are frustrated with generic content, I'd love an intro. No pressure — but you know the type I work well with."

### Referral Incentive Options
| Incentive | When |
|-----------|------|
| One month free | After referral becomes paying client |
| Revision credits | After referral books discovery call |
| Thoughtful gift | After referral signs (personal touch) |

---

## Recommendation

**MAKE "30/30" YOUR SIGNATURE.** It's the most contagious idea. Build all marketing around it. Clients will naturally share it because it's specific, memorable, and makes them look smart for finding it.
