# Agent Output: Tom Noske — Personal Brand Magnetism

> **Role**: Brand Architect | **Confidence**: HIGH

---

## Executive Summary

Farrice has the foundation for a Magnetic brand but is currently invisible. The key transition: from "Valuable & Boring" (expertise without visibility) to "Magnetic" (expertise that attracts). The "wounded healer" story is gold—needs to be front and center.

## Archetype Analysis

### Current State: The Invisible Expert
> Great expertise, minimal visibility. Known by those who've worked with him, unknown to everyone else.

**Symptoms**:
- Deep psychology expertise (18 years)
- Proprietary methodology (MES 3.0)
- Compelling story (family-first, wounded healer)
- BUT: Little-to-no LinkedIn presence
- BUT: No content demonstrating expertise
- BUT: Story hidden, not shared

### Target State: The Magnetic Architect
> The authority that attracts without chasing. Known for a specific way of thinking. Sought out by the right people.

**Markers**:
- Recognized positioning ("The AI-Augmented Authority Architect")
- Visible expertise through content
- Story creates emotional connection
- Clients self-select based on values alignment

## The 90/10 Content Formula

### 90%: Give Freely (Authority Building)
| Content Type | Purpose | Example |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Insights** | Demonstrate expertise | "Why most ghostwriters fail at voice (and what works instead)" |
| **Frameworks** | Create intellectual property | "The 3 layers of voice extraction most people miss" |
| **Stories** | Build emotional connection | "I spent 18 years helping others transform. Then I hit a wall myself." |
| **Observations** | Prove pattern recognition | "After studying 50 founder LinkedIn profiles, here's what the top 5% do differently" |

### 10%: Ask Clearly (Conversion Content)
| Content Type | Purpose | Example |
|--------------|---------|---------|
| **Offer post** | Direct invitation | "I have 2 spots opening for Q2. Here's who it's for." |
| **DM hook** | Trigger conversation | "If you've been posting inconsistently because nothing sounds like you, DM me 'VOICE'" |
| **Social proof** | Reduce risk | "Here's what happened when [Client] did their first brain dump" |

## Origin Story Iceberg Model

### Visible (What you share)
- Father-first identity
- 18 years in behavior change
- Frustration with generic content
- Built MES 3.0 to solve it

### Hidden (What gives depth)
- "Wounded healer" archetype (transformed self first)
- Refused hustle culture despite pressure
- Specific family moments that drive decisions
- AI expertise that's world-class (not just user)

### Anchor (The Core Truth)
> "I built a system to help others be seen because I know what it's like to be invisible despite having something valuable to say."

## Magnetic vs. Valuable & Boring

| Valuable & Boring | Magnetic |
|-------------------|----------|
| "I help founders create content" | "I turn 30-minute brain dumps into 30 days of content that sounds 100% like you" |
| "I have psychology expertise" | "18 years of behavior change science, applied to making you sound like you online" |
| "I do LinkedIn ghostwriting" | "I'm the AI-Augmented Authority Architect for Conscious Founders" |
| Feature-based | Story-based |
| Generic | Specific |
| Replaceable | Memorable |

## The $2-4/Follower Test

Magnetic personal brands generate $2-4 per follower annually. 

**Target**: $20K/month = $240K/year
**Required Followers**: 60K-120K (if monetizing via coaching/products)
**Required Followers**: 1,000-3,000 (if monetizing via high-ticket service)

**For Farrice**: Service model means follower count matters LESS. 
- 3,000 followers of the RIGHT people = 6 clients at $3K = $18K/month
- Quality over quantity

---

## Content Pillars (For Magnetic Brand)

1. **Voice Extraction**: The methodology (MES 3.0)
2. **Conscious Founders**: The audience identity
3. **Father-First**: The values alignment
4. **Authority Building**: The transformation
5. **Anti-Hustle**: The philosophy

---

## Recommendation

**LAUNCH THE 90-DAY MAGNETISM CAMPAIGN.** 90 days of consistent content across the 5 pillars, heavy on origin story and methodology. By day 91, you're not cold-calling — you're the obvious choice for Conscious Founders who want voice-authentic content.
