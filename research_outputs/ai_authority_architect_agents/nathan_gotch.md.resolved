### What LLMs Will Find

In 2026, buyers increasingly ask AI assistants: "Find me a LinkedIn ghostwriter for executives who cares about authentic voice."

**To appear in AI-generated answers, you need**:
1. Methodology pages that define terms (MES 3.0)

3. Case studies with specific numbers
4. Expert positioning in niche publications

### Content for Retrieval Layer

| Content Type | Purpose |
|--------------|---------|

## Competitor Digital Weaknesses

### Cleverly
- Strong on "LinkedIn lead generation" terms
- WEAK on "voice," "authenticity," "founder-focused" terms
- No methodology documentation

### The Media Engine
- Good Twitter presence
- WEAK on LinkedIn-specific SEO
- No founder-specific positioning

### Solo Operators
- Scattered presence
- No systematic SEO
- Rely on referrals only

---

## Recommended Domain Strategy

### Option 1: Personal Brand Site
`farricecain.com` or `fresh.works`

**Pros**: Full control, personal authority
**Cons**: No keyword in domain

### Option 2: Methodology Site
`voiceextraction.co` or `mes3.co`

**Pros**: Keyword-rich, methodology focus
**Cons**: Less personal

### Option 3: Niche Site
`consciousfounderghostwriter.com` or `authorityarchitect.io`

**Pros**: Niche targeting, high-intent buyers
**Cons**: Long domain, may feel generic

**Recommendation**: Lead with personal brand (`farricecain.com`), create methodology sub-page (`farricecain.com/mes3`)

## LinkedIn SEO (Profile Optimization)

### Headline Formula

**Current State of Competitors**:
- "LinkedIn Ghostwriter | Helping Founders..."
- "Content Strategist | Growing Personal Brands..."

**Recommended Headline**:
> "The AI-Augmented Authority Architect | I turn your 30-minute brain dump into 30 days of LinkedIn content that sounds 100% like you | MES 3.0 Voice Extraction"

**Why This Works**:
- Includes unique title ("Authority Architect")
- Specific methodology (MES 3.0)
- Outcome-based ("30 min → 30 days")
- Addresses core fear ("100% like you")

2. Founder-focused case studies
3. LinkedIn-optimized profile with unique headline
4. Podcast guesting for backlinks + retrieval layer
