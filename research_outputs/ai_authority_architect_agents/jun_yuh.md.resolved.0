## Hook Framework

First line patterns that work:

| Pattern | Example |
|---------|---------|
| **Contrarian** | "Your ghostwriter is hurting your business." |
| **Number** | "30 minutes → 30 days of content." |
| **Question** | "What if LinkedIn posts could sound exactly like you?" |
| **Story** | "I fired 3 ghostwriters in 2 years." |
| **Observation** | "Most founder content sounds the same. Here's why." |

## Recommendation

**BATCH CREATE ON SUNDAYS.** Spend 2 hours Sunday creating the week's 3 posts. Schedule in LinkedIn scheduler. Spend weekdays only engaging, not creating. This preserves the 1-3 hour/day constraint.
