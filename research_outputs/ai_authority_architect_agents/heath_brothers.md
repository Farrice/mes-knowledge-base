# Agent Output: Heath Brothers — Message Stickiness

> **Role**: Stickiness Architects | **Confidence**: HIGH

---

## Executive Summary

Applied the SUCCESs framework to Farrice's messaging. Key finding: The "30/30" promise is inherently sticky. The "MES 3.0" name needs human translation. The "wounded healer" story is the emotional anchor that makes everything memorable.

---

## SUCCESs Framework Applied

### S — Simple (Core Message)

**Current State**: Multiple competing messages
- Voice extraction
- AI-augmented
- Authority architect
- 30/30 promise
- Psychology background

**Simplified Core**:
> "I turn your 30-minute brain dump into 30 days of LinkedIn content that sounds 100% like you."

**The Commander's Intent**:
> "Busy founder gets visible without compromising voice or time."

### U — Unexpected (Breaks Pattern)

**Pattern**: Ghostwriters require hours of interviews and revision cycles

**Pattern Break**: 
> "30 minutes. That's it. One conversation per month."

**The Curiosity Gap**:
> "How does one 30-minute call produce a month of authentic content?"

### C — Concrete (Specific, Not Abstract)

| Abstract (Avoid) | Concrete (Use) |
|-----------------|----------------|
| "Build your authority" | "Have 3 people per week say 'I love your posts'" |
| "Sound authentic" | "Your own team won't know you didn't write it" |
| "Save time on content" | "Close your laptop at 3pm knowing you have content til end of month" |
| "Voice extraction" | "I ask questions like 'What makes you angry about your industry?'" |

### C — Credible (Proof Points)

| Credibility Type | Example |
|------------------|---------|
| **Expert** | 18 years studying behavior change |
| **Anti-authority** | "I refused to use generic AI for my own content" |
| **Testable** | "Read the first draft. If it doesn't sound like you, we start over" |
| **Details** | "The MES 3.0 extraction has 17 specific question patterns" |
| **Client proof** | Testimonials with specific outcomes |

### E — Emotional (Care, Not Just Think)

**The Identity Frame**:
> "For founders who refuse to sound like everyone else."

**The Villain**:
> Generic AI content that makes you cringe

**The Hero Journey**:
> From invisible expert to recognized authority (while staying true to yourself)

**The Emotional Core**:
> "I know what it's like to have valuable things to say and no way to share them without sacrificing what matters."

### S — Story (Narrative Vehicle)

**The Core Story** (90 seconds):
> "I spent 18 years helping people transform. I was great at it. But when it came to sharing my own expertise online, I couldn't do it. Ghostwriters didn't sound like me. AI sounded robotic. I was invisible.

> So I built a system. I combined everything I knew about psychology with AI. The result: I could capture someone's unique thinking in 30 minutes and produce a month of content that sounds exactly like them.

> I call it MES 3.0. Now I help conscious founders who refuse to sound like everyone else become the visible authority they deserve to be. Without the hustle. Without the inauthenticity."

## Sticky Phrases (Memory Hooks)

| Phrase | Why It Sticks |
|--------|---------------|
| **"30/30"** | Numbers are concrete and memorable |
| **"Brain dump"** | Casual, approachable, de-mystifying |
| **"100% like you"** | Addresses core fear directly |
| **"Genius capture"** | Elevates the client |
| **"Authority asset"** | Reframes content as investment |
| **"Visible in 90 days"** | Specific timeline creates urgency |

---

## What Doesn't Stick (Avoid)

| Phrase | Why It Fails |
|--------|--------------|
| "AI-Augmented Authority Architect" | Too many syllables, too abstract |
| "MES 3.0" | Needs human translation |
| "Voice extraction methodology" | Academic, not emotional |
| "Thought leadership content" | Cliché, eye-roll inducing |

---

## Recommendation

**LEAD WITH "30/30" AND THE FATHER STORY.** The number hook is simple and concrete. The story creates emotional resonance. Together, they make the offer memorable in a sea of "LinkedIn ghostwriters."
