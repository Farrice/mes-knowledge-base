| 2. Captivation | Open curiosity gap | "I spent $50K on ghostwriters. Here's what finally worked." |
| 3. Anticipation | Partial reveal builds tension | "The 3 voice extraction questions most ghostwriters never ask" |
| 4. Validation | Non-obvious payoff | Actual framework revelation that changes thinking |
| 5. Affection | Warm, human connection | Personal story of "father wound" driving family-first business |

## Content Strategy Recommendations

### Topic Priority (Brick 1)
1. Voice authenticity vs. AI generic
2. Time leverage for busy founders
3. Authority building (not vanity metrics)
4. Personal brand without being cringe
5. Conscious capitalism messaging

### Hook Formula (Brick 3)
- Contrarian: "Most ghostwriters fail for one reason..."
- Specificity: "I analyzed 47 founder posts. Here's what the top 3% do differently."
- Pain: "You have 10x the expertise but 1/10th the visibility. Here's why."
- Story: "I fired 3 ghostwriters before building my own system."

## Recommendation

**BUILD THE TRUST ECOSYSTEM.** One-shot content won't convert. Need consistent presence across multiple formats to hit 7-11-4 threshold with Conscious Founders who are naturally skeptical.
