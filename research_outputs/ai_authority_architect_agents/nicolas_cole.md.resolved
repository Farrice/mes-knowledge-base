### Week 2: Warm Outreach

**Day 8-10: Personal Asks**
Send 10 personal messages to warm connections:

```
Hey [Name],

I've launched something new — helping conscious founders 
turn 30-minute brain dumps into 30 days of LinkedIn content 
that sounds exactly like them.

Two asks:
1) Do you know any founders frustrated with generic content 
   or ghostwriters who don't sound right?
2) Would you be open to being one of my first 3 beta clients 
   (free, in exchange for honest feedback)?

No pressure either way — just exploring who this resonates with.
```

**Day 11-14: Follow-Up**
- [ ] Follow up on non-responses (one touch)
- [ ] Schedule calls with interested parties
- [ ] Continue posting (3x this week)

## Sniper List Criteria

### Green Flags (Ideal Client Signals)
| Signal | Where to Find |
|--------|---------------|
| Posted inconsistently (3+ month gaps) | LinkedIn activity |
| Bio mentions "purpose" or "impact" | Headline/About |
| Bootstrapped company | About or website |
| Mentioned on Conscious Capitalism | Profile or search |
| Complained about content/ghostwriters | Posts or comments |
| 100K+ revenue indicators | Company size, team |

### Red Flags (Avoid)
| Signal | Why |
|--------|-----|
| Marketing/Content in title | They do this themselves |
| Agency employee | Not decision maker |
| Large corporate | Wrong buyer type |
| VC-funded "growth at all costs" | Values mismatch |
| Recent ghostwriter posts | Already solved |

---

## Discovery Call Framework

### Pre-Call: Qualification
- Confirmed founder/executive role
- Expressed content frustration
- Revenue indicators ($200K+)

### Call Structure (15 min)
1. **Context** (2 min): "What made you interested in this?"
2. **Pain** (5 min): "What's been frustrating about content so far?"
3. **Solution** (3 min): Brief MES 3.0 overview
4. **Fit** (3 min): "Here's what working together looks like"

## First Client Target Profile

**Ideal First Client**:
- Founder/CEO of $200K-$2M service business
- Purpose-driven or "conscious" in orientation
- Has tried ghostwriters or DIY and failed
- Values authenticity over vanity metrics
- Has budget ($2K+/mo is trivial for them)
- BONUS: Already in your network or one degree away

---

## Recommendation

**START WITH YOUR WARM NETWORK.** Cold outreach will take 90 days to work. Your first client is already one connection away. Make 10 personal asks this week. One of them will say yes.
